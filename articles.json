[{"relevance": [423.5], "text": "ONE WOULDN'T expect the owner of a small chain of tea-centric restaurants to be particularly thrilled about Starbucks' entry into the tea market, with its purchase of the Teavana chain last year. But Jesse Jacobs, the owner of San Francisco's three Samovar Tea Lounges is surprisingly enthusiastic about it.\n\"It's a recognition that tea is the next big thing,\" says Jacobs, who opened his first tea lounge 13 years ago. \"I see it as a good thing. It validates the growing market for tea.\"\nAnd tea is trending with a capital T. \nA quick scan of the aisles at the grocery store provides further proof, with a mind boggling array of teas encroaching on coffee's territory, including two Bay Area produced brands: Novato's Republic of Tea and Numi Organic Teas out of Oakland.\nAccording to the Tea Association of the USA, the wholesale tea industry has grown from an estimated $2 billion dollars in 1990 to an estimated $10 billion in 2013, and that number is expected to almost double over the next few years.\nSpeaking rapidly, partly because of his passion for the subject and perhaps because he'd just spent the morning sampling 30 varieties of tea from Nepal, Jacobs indicated the increasing demand for tea is due in part to mounting evidence of its health benefits as well as growing interest in quality artisan foods and beverages.\nBut tea, with all its varieties   from green to black to oolong to the somewhat funky, fermented pu-erh   can be intimidating.\nChristopher Coccagna is a San Francisco tea sommelier and owner of T-We Teas, where he crafts his own tea blends. Like Jacobs, Coccagna helps customers navigate the complexities of tea, teaching them how to taste, brew and even pair teas with food.\nEven without access to a tea expert, there are plenty of resources for those interested in learning more about tea and food pairings. Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page, authors of \"What to Drink with What You Eat\" (Bulfinch, 2006), say those who enjoy wine are likely to also enjoy tea. Pairing it with food follows similar guidelines: Lighter, green teas pair best with things like seafood and chicken, while stronger black teas go well with beef and spicy dishes.\nTea mixology\nThe growing taste for tea isn't limited to just what's sold in cups, either. Trend forecasts show it's spilling over onto dinner plates, and into desserts and cocktails in particular. Andrew Freeman & Co., a San Francisco-based restaurant and hospitality consulting company, predicts that \"tea-tails\" will show up on more beverage menus as mixologists turn to tea and tea-based liqueurs to expand their repertoire.\nFrom the Earl Grey-infused gin used in a Marteani at Martin's West in Redwood City to the Lady Marmalade, a blend of Qi white tea liqueur, brandy and citrus at the Village Pub in Woodside, tea is already proving to be a tasty addition to a tipple.\nTea cocktails can be as simple as brewing a pot of tea at home.\nCoccagna created several winter cocktails using tea and milk for the Got Milk campaign because of the two ingredients' natural affinity. His favorite is the White Russian Caravan, a concoction of smoky Russian Caravan tea, vodka and coffee liqueur, with a milk float.\nMaster mixologist Jim Meehan has a recipe for a party-perfect green tea and rum punch that's little more than brewed tea, rum and lime juice.\nOn the plate\nChefs use tea leaves and brewed tea, not just because it's trendy, but also because the tannins in tea complement the fats in things like meat and dairy, while adding subtle flavor.\nTea has long been used in dishes like the classic Sichuan tea-smoked duck and tea-leaf salad, a popular offering at Burmese restaurants in the Bay Area. At Samovar, Jacobs uses tea in rubs for fish and poultry, as well as the basis for a brothy, Japanese-style soup.\nTasting menus at the Michelin-starred Baume in Menlo Park and Manresa in Los Gatos have recently featured tea. Manresa's David Kinch serves squab with prunes in black tea, and his much-heralded first cookbook, released last year, features a few recipes using tea, including smoked salmon roe in a black tea and bonito jelly.\nCreamy and chocolaty desserts are a common vehicle for tea as well. Green tea ice cream is almost standard at Japanese restaurants, and green tea macarons are popular at Chantal Guillon shops in San Francisco and Palo Alto.\nBergamot-laced Earl Grey tea also makes regular dessert menu appearances, popping up in panna cotta at San Francisco's Fifth Floor and in the cr\u00cbme Anglaise served with the chocolate souffle at the Village Pub. And former Novato resident Yigit Pura uses organic Earl Grey to flavor a dark chocolate macaron named in honor of \"Star Trek\" Capt. Jean Luc Picard in his Macy's Union Square patisserie, Tout Sweet.\nBut for devotees like Jacobs and Coccagna, tea is more than an ingredient in a dish or even a drink. It's a lifestyle.\n\"In an era dominated by distraction and cellphones, tea helps us connect with our humanity,\" says Jacobs, whose menu invites people to turn off their gadgets and spend time communicating face to face over a cup of tea.\nCoccagna echoes that, saying tea is about community and collaboration.\n\"Typically you share tea with someone,\" he says. \"There's beauty in that exchange.\"\nRECIPES\nGreen tea rum punch\nMakes 10 servings\nNote: Use the package instructions to brew the Sencha and Moroccan mint teas.\n1\u03a9 cups brewed Sencha tea\n1\u03a9 cups brewed Moroccan mint tea\n1 cup raw demerara sugar\n1\u00ba cups freshly squeezed lime juice\n750 ml blended English-style rum, such as Banks \"5 Island\" Blended Rum\nFreshly grated nutmeg to garnish\nBrew the Sencha and Moroccan mint teas in  3 cups of boiling water  using package instructions. Add the raw sugar to the hot tea  and stir until the sugar dissolves. Steep the tea for a few minutes. Remove the tea bags/leaves and discard.\nPour the tea into a large pitcher; add a quart of crushed ice to cool it. Add the lime juice and rum, and stir to incorporate.\nTo serve, pour the mixture into a punch bowl with a large chunk of ice. Ladle each cocktail into a punch glass and garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.\n  Jim Meehan, mixologist, Panna Digital App\nMushroom assam risotto\nMakes 4 to 6 servings\nNote: India's Assam region is famous for its malty black tea with characteristic notes of sea salt and rich caramel tones. This twist on a traditional recipe applies a \"tea stock\" in a new way to create a rich, complex dish.\n4 cups vegetable or chicken stock\n3 tablespoons Indian Assam black tea\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n2 cloves garlic, crushed\n1 leek, white part only, thinly sliced\n2 cups Arborio rice\n\u00ba cup fresh Italian parsley, chopped\nGrated Parmesan cheese, optional\nSalt, pepper to taste\nMushrooms:\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 tablespoon butter\n1 cup chanterelle mushrooms, cut in long strips\nDash balsamic vinegar\nIn a saucepan over medium heat, bring the stock to a boil. Place the Assam tea in a large tea or herb ball and drop it into the stock. Reduce heat to low; let steep 5 minutes. Stock will brew into a rich brown mixture with red tones.\nIn another large saucepan over medium heat, warm the 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add garlic and leek; saute until translucent, but do not brown. Add rice and stir until partially translucent.\nLadle hot tea stock, \u03a9 cup at a time, into the rice mixture, stirring until the liquid is almost completely absorbed before adding more. Repeat, stirring, until all the liquid is absorbed and the risotto reaches a firm, but chewy consistency.\nMeanwhile, heat the oil and butter for the mushrooms in a saute pan. Add the chanterelles and a dash of balsamic vinegar; saute until the liquid is absorbed, about 4 minutes.\nGently stir the parsley into the risotto. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve the risotto with mushrooms on top, garnished with Parmesan cheese.\n  Christopher Coccagna, tea sommelier\nWhite Russian Caravan\nMakes 4 servings\n1 cup water\n2 tablespoons Russian Caravan black tea\n4 ounces vodka\n2 ounces coffee liqueur\n1 cup whole milk\nBring water to a boil. Add tea in a tea ball; let steep 5 minutes. Let cool in refrigerator (without diluting with ice).\nIn a martini shaker, combine 4 ounces cold tea, 4 ounces vodka, 2 ounces coffee liqueur and a scoop of ice. Shake vigorously for 10 seconds.\nPlace 2 or 3 large ice cubes into each of 4 highball glasses. Strain the shaker contents into the glasses. Float 2 ounces of whole milk on top of each cocktail.\n  Christopher Coccagna, tea sommelier, Got Milk campaign\nSamovar tea ocha zuke (tea soup)\nMakes 2 to 4 servings\n2 cups water\n2 tablespoons robust green tea, such as ryokucha or ho jicha\n1 cup cooked brown rice or sushi rice\n\u03a9 cup steamed carrots, cut into bite-sized pieces\n\u03a9 cup steamed broccoli, cut into bite-sized florets\n1 to 2 ounces smoked salmon, cut into bite-sized pieces\n1 teaspoon sesame oil\n1 teaspoon tamari soy sauce\nGarnish: toasted nori seaweed, sesame seeds and chopped scallions\nBoil water, pour over tea and let steep for 3 minutes.\nPlace rice, carrots, broccoli, smoked salmon, sesame oil and soy sauce in a large soup bowl or individual bowls. Pour tea over the ingredients in the bowl(s).

This would cause a loss of jobs, especially in the construction industry.\nThe real answer is to increase the supply of water and let the users pay the cost.\nTechnological advances, both here and around the world, are also a critical part of the answer.\nMMWD has had four decades to solve the supply part of the problem and it is obvious that the directors and senior management have failed to produce a short- and long-term answer.\nManagement will blame the weather; however, the weather is what it is and management should have anticipated that this record drought would eventually arrive.\nPerhaps MMWD directors will perform a traditional rain dance in the hope of appeasing the rain gods.\nIf they want to blame someone or something, they should look in the mirror.\nLuke Mazur, Belvedere\nExpand the reservoirs\nThere will never be enough water in Marin unless we increase our reservoir capactiy.\nThere's no need for consultants, simply dig and deepen the existing lakes.\nAlan Larkins, San Rafael\nA real Marin 'blizzard'\nThe members of the Marin Board of Supervisors spent a fair amount of time at their meeting Tuesday defending their belief that high-density development is OK and belongs along the Highway 101 corridor.\nSupervisor Katie Rice had to add the caveat, as she led the charge, by making sure we all knew that the county board had absolutely nothing to do with the massive high-density housing development at Corte Madera's old WinCup site.\nHowever, she didn't hesitate to state that the project is not out of context with the rest of the development along Highway 101 and that we all needed to \"put it in perspective.\"\nShe closed her long-winded speech with a request for all of us to be honest without pointing fingers and stating that the supervisors have been listening very hard to their constituents.\nSupervisor Steve Kinsey piled on, saying that Marin County has had the longest standing vision, going back 40 years, of preserving our coast and agricultural lands and that there seems to be a \"blizzard of fear and concern   no rain   but a blizzard of fear\" surrounding development along 101.\nSupervisor Judy Arnold made a leap, intimating that if we don't accept development along the 101 corridor that somehow our open space and West Marin land will be threatened.\nI will tell you what blizzard is brewing: It is the people who are tired of the blatant disregard by our elected officials for what most of the residents in Marin want.\nWe want to keep Marin suburban, not urban.\nHundreds of us spent hours attending all the Planning Commission and board hearings on the housing element in 2013 but no one listened.\nUnless \"we the people\" stand up and do something now, the 101 corridor will be lined with more high-density housing like the WinCup development.\nCarol Brandt, San RafaeL", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 16"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "ON JAN. 19 AND 21, the Marin Symphony honors Martin Luther King, performing composer Joseph Schwantner's \"New Morning for World,\" an homage to the late civil rights leader built around his selected oratory. I am privileged to narrate.\nIn reading historian Taylor Branch's exhaustive three-volume trilogy, beginning with \"Parting the Waters,\" America during the King years, one is struck by how far we've come while at the same time acknowledging how far we've yet to go. \nAmerica before King was a much different place. One needn't go any further than the twice-elected President Barack Obama to prove it.\nIn the 1980s, on a program with Ed Asner, TV's Lou Grant quipped what was then axiomatic humor. \"A Jewish person, a woman and a black person all had an audience with God. The Jewish person asked: 'Will there ever be a Jewish president. The Lord answered: 'Yes, there will be a Jewish president, but not in your lifetime.' The woman asked similarly: 'Lord will there ever be a female president?' The Lord spoke: 'Yes my daughter that too will come to pass. But not in your lifetime.' The Brother asked: Lord, will there be a black president? Yes my son, the creator answered balefully ... but not in My lifetime.'\"\nYesterday's impossibility is today's miracle and tomorrow's fact.\nThe 1954 the Brown decision no doubt empowered King to infuse black people with what his mentor Howard Thurman called, \"a strange new valor.\" Borrowing a description of Winston Churchill, Martin Luther King, from the pulpit of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, \"mobilized the English language and sent it into battle\" against the entrenched forces of American apartheid.\nHe became the spiritual field general of the Montgomery bus boycott, preaching non-violent transformation, symbolized by the courage of Rosa Parks. On to Birmingham, Atlanta, Chicago and beyond, his soaring oratory and searing truth prodded the aroused conscience of America, prompting President Lyndon Johnson to push through the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the '65 Voting Rights Act and the 1968 Fair Housing legislation.\nThe question is always asked of the great, were they alive today how would they view our present world.\nWe get a hint of that when King writes: \"I submit to you that any individual who decides to break a law that conscience tells him is unjust and is willing to accept the penalty for it is at that moment expressing the very highest respect for the law. There is nothing new about this. Go back with me if you will to the Old Testament. See Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego as they stand before King Nebuchadnezzar. They made it clear: 'We cannot come.' Come if you will to Plato's Dialogues. Open the Credo or the Apology. See Socrates practicing civil disobedience. Academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience. Come to the early Christians. See them practicing civil disobedience to the point they were willing to be thrown to the lions to stand up for what they believed. Listen to Peter as he says, 'We must obey God rather than man.'\n\"Come to the modern world. Never forget that everything Hitler did was legal. It was illegal to comfort and aid a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And I believe if I had lived there ... I would have disobeyed that law.\n\"If I lived in South Africa today I would join with Chief Luthuli as he says to his people, 'Break this law. Don't take this unjust pass system ... tear them up.'\"\nAmerica, South Africa and the world has benefitted from the lasting legacy of Martin Luther King.\nNoah Griffin of Tiburon is a public affairs consultant and a former community member of the IJ's editorial board.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Noah Griffin of Tiburon. .\nNoah Griffin", "author": "By Noah Griffin Guest op-ed column", "title": "Marin Voice: Celebrating Martin Luther King's vision"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Tim Lee did his time at grad school, putting his parents' money to use at the University of California at Davis.

I didn't have anything exciting to do.\"\nSo Lee did the unexpected   he became a stand-up comic, which must have been a curve ball to his tuition-paying parents.\nDabble in some community theater to see how the business goes? Not for Lee, who decided to dive head-first into this funny-for-money field.\n\"When entertainers would be interviewed, the actors always seemed stupid, but the comedians were sharp,\" Lee says. \"I needed to do something, so I decided to do an open mike and try some jokes.\"\nNot all was perfect, but Lee quickly realized he'd leave science behind.\n\"I said something that I didn't mean to be a joke, but everyone laughed,\" he says. \"It was enough of a thrill for me.

Police found a duffel bag containing nine cellphones inside the vehicle and took the property into evidence.\nRoberts was apparently released on bail. Police later determined that at least one of the cellphones had been stolen by a window-smashing burglar at Cambio Plus International, a cellphone and money order business on Bellam Boulevard in San Rafael.\nThen, on Jan. 8, a man stole four Infinitis and a Mercedes from the Infiniti dealership in Kirkland. Police Lt. Mike Murray said the burglar accessed the dealership through a back door and stole car keys from a counter, then found the matching cars in the sales lot.\nHe drove off in the cars one by one and parked them in a lot nearby, Murray said.\nLate the next night, the man returned in the stolen Mercedes but triggered a burglary alarm. That set off a police chase that ended when the suspect crashed into a retaining wall and escaped in a slough.\n\"Even though it was freezing, he swam a pretty good distance and got away from us that night,\" Murray said. \"He just crashed that car and bounded right away. He's a slippery one.\"\nOn Tuesday, police received a report that Roberts had been seen at Ritter Center in downtown San Rafael. When Roberts returned on Wednesday morning, someone at the center called the police department.\nAs police converged on the area, Roberts bolted toward Fourth Street and then turned back south, darting toward the city parking garage at Third Street and Lootens Place, police said.\nWitnesses Tracey Milne and J.R. Roloff said the suspect displayed considerable agility in evading a group of gun-wielding officers.\n\"He was like a springbok,\" said Milne, a native of South Africa.\nRoberts was arrested after jumping from the second story of the parking garage, bouncing off the awning of a business and crashing to the pavement, Rohrbacher said. San Rafael firefighters took Roberts to Marin General Hospital for treatment of minor injuries.\nRoberts was released from the hospital Wednesday and booked into Marin County Jail. His bail was initially set at $200,000.\nRoberts' criminal history in Marin includes convictions for resisting arrest, possession of stolen property and driving without a license, according to court records.\nIn February 2011, he was arrested after an alleged crime rampage in downtown San Rafael. Police said he tried to rob a man at a cash machine, threatened customers with a fork at a downtown restaurant and kicked a police officer in the head.\nContact Gary Klien via email atgklien@marinij.com orhttps://twitter.com/GaryKlien", "author": "By Gary Klien", "title": "San Rafael police arrest fugitive suspect after plunge from parking garage"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "In response to an ongoing drought, beginning Thursday the Marin Municipal Water District will start pumping water out of Phoenix Lake, a reserve reservoir.\nOver the next 30 days the district will pump water from the reservoir to the district's Bon Tempe treatment plant on the Mount Tamalpais watershed and then into the water distribution system that serves customers in central and southern Marin.\nThe move will drop the water level in Phoenix Lake by 20 feet if there is no rain over the period. \n\"It will be a very visual reminder of what is going on,\" said Libby Pischel, district spokeswoman.\nThe district doesn't like to use the lake because of the cost to pump millions of gallons of water 600 feet uphill to the Bon Tempe reservoir, but it has little choice given the dearth of rain.\n\"Our system flows downhill, but this will require us to pump uphill,\" said Mike Ban, engineering manager for the water district.\nHe added the district wants to use the Phoenix Lake supply now before it begins to evaporate. In all some 200 acre feet will be pumped from the reservoir over the next month. An acre foot can supply about three single-family homes with water for a year. There are 325,851 gallons in an acre foot.\nThe district is also in the process of preparing the Soulajule Reservoir   another reserve water supply   for activation this spring if the rains do not come.\nPhoenix Lake was last tapped for 11 days in March 2012, but then the rains came as part of a \"Miracle March\" deluge. Before that, Phoenix and Soulajule were used during a drought between 1987 and 1992.\nThe current drought led to Marin recording a record-low 10.68 inches of rain in 2013 at Lake Lagunitas, where the water district   which has data dating to 1879   keeps its official weather gauge. The previous record low in Marin was set in 1929 when 19.06 inches of rain fell. The annual average is 52 inches per year.\nThe previous record low was set in 1929 when 19.06 inches of rain fell. The annual average is 52 inches per year. Even 1976   the first year of the major 1976-77 drought   saw more rain with 21.34 inches.\nUnlike some districts that receive water from melt off from a potent Sierra snowpack, Marin is at the mercy of real-time rain, which provides much of the drinking water for the county via eight reservoirs, most on Mount Tamalpais and one at Stafford Lake in Novato. The rest comes from the Russian River, which also is fed by local rains.\nWater managers are taking notice of the drought. Last month the Marin Municipal Water District Board of Directors passed a resolution acknowledging the extreme dry weather conditions. The district is asking the public to watch water use.\nIt is also maximizing the use of Nicasio Reservoir, which fills faster than the other six reservoirs when it does rain; canceled an annual flushing of its water distribution system and is preparing an early start for its recycled water plant used for irrigation, among other steps.\nOn average, Mount Tam reservoirs at this time of year are at 77 percent of capacity, but now stand at 55 percent. Rationing won't be formally addressed until April 1 per Marin Municipal board policy. At that point if there are 50,000 or fewer acre feet in the system, a 10 percent voluntary rationing program would kick in. If there is less than 40,000 acre feet, a 25 percent mandatory program would be implemented. As of this week there were 43,943 acre feet in the reservoirs.\n\"This is unprecedented, 2013 was our driest year on record,\" said Krishna Kumar, general manager of the district. \"We are taking the appropriate steps, but we are getting into some uncharted territory.\"\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com", "author": "By Mark Prado", "title": "Water district to start using Phoenix Lake for water supply as rains stay away"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "By Tim Menicutch\nAt 6-foot-5, Brandon Kenilvort was pretty much used to having his way when he roamed the paint for the Drake High basketball team.\nKenilvort, starting freshman forward for College of Marin, learned in a hurry the glory days of high school are meaningless at the next level.\nHe remembers back in summer when the COM men's team got together for its first shoot around. \n\"We were playing five-on-five for the first time in front of the whole team,\" Kenilvort said. \"So I get this fastbreak layup and I just completely missed a slam dunk. I'm there trying to prove a point about how tough I was and all the other guys are probably thinking, 'Look at that sorry white boy from Marin.'\"\nThe humbling experience was just the tip of the iceberg for Kenilvort in his realization of how difficult the transition to college basketball really is.\n\"Early on in the season, Brandon and I had a long conversation in my office,\" said COM coach Dave Granucci, who has a young Mariners team (9-7, 3-2 Bay Valley Conference) off to a fast start in conference play. \"Instead of telling me what I wanted to hear, he was open and honest and he told me he wasn't where he wanted to be. From that point on, he's been a better player. I think he now understands what it takes to play at the college level.\"\nKenilvort, a resident of San Anselmo, says his biggest problem was the adjustment to the speed of the college game.\n\"I heard it 100 times. Everybody told me, even coach Granucci and (Drake) coach (Doug) Donnellan, about how the speed of the game was a lot faster,\" Kenilvort said. \"But still, it was really an eye-opening experience on how quick everything moves.\"\nOn top of adjusting to the accelerated pace, Kenilvort said he had another stark realization. He was no longer the big kid on the court. In fact, at times he felt slight in comparison to some of his opponents.\n\"In college, there are a lot of big strong kids that make me look like I should be playing in the perimeter or something,\" he said.\nEven as he struggled with the transition, Kenilvort kept reminding himself of one important fact.\n\"If I wasn't good enough to play at this level, I wouldn't be here playing,\" he said. \"I have to tell myself every time I go on the court that I know I have the ability to play at this level.\"\nSo, there he was in a big new world. Since he was no longer bigger or faster or stronger than his opponents, he had no choice but to refine, and more importantly, redefine his role on the court.\nHe worked meticulously in practice on positioning and thinking one step ahead on defense. Holding no physical advantages, he was forced to find an edge on the cerebral side, most notably with pure intensity and focus.\n\"Coach Granucci has this motto that we can't take one play off, not one second to try to catch your breath,\" Kenilvort said. \"If you do, you're a sitting duck out there. It's happened to me on defense where I'm just standing up on defense and somebody blows right by me. On defense, you have to go 100 percent all the time.\"\nGranucci said this season most of his freshman-dominated team has experienced the same sort of shock as Kenilvort. The coach said there's only one way over the hurdle.\n\"You have to get out and play and see the speed of game,\" Granucci said. \"The athletes have to figure out it's a thinking man's game, that they really have to think it out and make smart plays.\"\nKenilvort is figuring it out.\n\"If I can't jump as high, I have to box out harder,\" he said. \"If I'm not as quick, then it's all about positioning and being one step ahead.\"\nOne of nine freshmen on COM's surprising BVC-contending team, Kenilvort understands his role and is comfortable with it.\n\"I know my role,\" he said. \"We have some guys who can score better than I could ever dream of scoring. I try to clean up around the rim, and yeah, defense is a huge part of our team. That's what I focus on in games. I take pride in my defense. I know everybody else can score. I never worry about getting my shots up, but instead worry about defensive stops, blocking shots and pulling down rebounds. Those kinds of things make my game for me.\"\nGranucci says Kenilvort has come a long way already this season. And he quickly adds, his freshman forward is only scratching the surface of how good a college player he can become.\n\"He's still learning the game,\" Granucci said. \"He's going to improve tremendously as the year goes on and we're going to see a big jump in his play when he's sophomore. He had a play the other day off a rebound. He dribbles once and goes up with two guys hanging on him. There's no foul and he misses the shot. A year from now he goes through that contact, explodes and finishes the play.\"\nContact Tim Menicutch via email atsports@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: College of Marin basketball player Brandon Kenilvort poses for a photo in Kentfield, Calif. on Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2014.

The organization works in various capacities with Marin's underserved communities, such as Marin City and San Rafael's Canal area, to combat the cycle of poverty.\nEthel Seiderman, a longtime advocate for child care and early childhood education, was honored. Jose Varela, Marin's public defender, received an award for his focus on restorative justice.\nFour businesses also received awards: Westamerica Bank, Tamalpie Pizza, owned by Karen Goldberg; Fiji Resources, owned by Eli Drake and his wife, Lisa Saunders; and the Marin County Post, a black-owned community newspaper that has been in circulation for 50 years.\nThat mission aligns with Jones' work, which largely focuses on solutions for strengthening the economy, and doing so in a manner that includes   and in the process, improves   minority populations that struggle with low levels of education and high levels of incarceration.\nJones, a black man with a law degree from Yale University, served in the Obama administration for a few months in 2009, as an adviser to the Council on Environmental Quality. He resigned under a cloud of controversy. Conservatives raised concerns about some matters in Jones' past, including derogatory remarks he made about Republicans in Congress, and that his name appeared on a 9/11 conspiracy petition.

The part that is remembered, and still resonates today, Jones said, is the section envisioning a future of racial harmony and justice.\n\"What's the future we're fighting for now?\" Jones said. \"Because if you can't explain that to people, you're just going to have a bunch of bad statistics, some interesting legislative proposals, and a bunch of white guilt. ... and very little progress in these (underserved) communities.\"\nJones drew on the common name between Martin Luther King and Trayvon Martin   the black teenager from Florida whose story became national news after he was fatally shot by neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman   to show that the country still has room to improve regarding race relations.\nHe argued that improving both race relations and the outlook for young blacks and Latinos has long-term economic benefits.\n\"You could have 10,000 Mark Zuckerbergs,\" Jones said, referring to the CEO and co-founder of Facebook. \"But a whole lot of them could look like Trayvon Martin.\"\nContact Laith Agha via email at lagha@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: CNN correspondent Van Jones gets his photograph taken with Cliff Fried on Wednesday, Jan. 15, 2014, in San Rafael, Calif.

The updated proposal suggests building 105 units on the 3.5-acre site.\n\"Our proposal today is closer to 30 units per acre,\" Gruendl said. \"The older apartment buildings out behind Marin Joe's and out toward Peet's, as calculated by your town staff, have densities as high as 50 units per acre.\" \nThe updated proposal includes building one- and two-bedroom apartments in two- and three-story buildings, instead of having one of the buildings as tall as four stories. There would also be sub-level parking beneath the apartments.\nNeighbors first learned of the proposed development in October when Gruendl and his associates invited about 100 neighbors of the complex to a meeting at the Best Western Corte Madera Inn. Attendees viewed the plans and were horrified by the sketches, citing concerns about increased traffic congestion, water availability, local school capacity and a lack of parking.\nThey also raised concerns about the proposed apartments being similar to the 180-unit apartment complex at the former WinCup site on Tamal Vista Boulevard in Corte Madera. The highly-visible development is a sore subject for those who feel it's too massive.\nAt the second meeting Wednesday, all of those same concerns were aired and a majority of the crowd was raucous and outspoken about their hatred of the proposed development. While many argued nothing new should be built at the site at all, others said they'd be more supportive of the idea if there were fewer than 105 units.\nCorte Madera resident Milena Belloni said the proposed development needs to be smaller and fit into the surrounding community.\n\"I don't think any of us are opposed to change, we just want it done right,\" Belloni said. \"There's a limit to how much you can do in the county.\"\nFor Christie Diederick the proposed apartment complex is personal. She lives at the Marin Gardens apartments and would have to relocate if Gruendl's proposed development is built. She said more luxury apartments aren't needed in the community, and affordable housing is hard to come by.\n\"The community there is really beautiful right now,\" Diederick said. \"The people who stay should get to stay with their current rental rate.\"\nGruendl said he's still trying to determine whether the complex might include 10 or 20 percent of its apartments as affordable units. He said most of the luxury apartments that he hopes to build on the site in 2015 for 2016 move-in dates would rent for $2,700 in today's market.\nNot everyone was outraged by the proposed development. David Kunhardt, who ran for a seat on the Corte Madera Town Council in November, said he was pleased with the changes Gruendl made.\n\"I think it was a good thing for him to listen and come back with a density that's 25 percent lower than his prior proposal and also limiting it to three stories,\" Kunhardt said.\nDespite the changes, the development would still hinge on the town's passage of a zoning amendment, increasing the allowed density on the site. The site is zoned for low-density multi-dwellings with a maximum of 10.9 units per acre.\nAny sort of discussion about rezoning the property has yet to take place as BayRock Multifamily has not filed any official plans with the town, according to Planning Director Dan Bell.\n\"Anything beyond what's allowed right now would necessitate a general plan amendment and zoning amendment,\" Bell said.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

Sears cited concerns that included the deck, noting it intruded on privacy of the neighbors.\nCounty planners had voted 4-3 to eliminate the deck but uphold height and related conditions imposed by a zoning administrator.\nAt issue were plans for a 2,935-square-foot home, 297-square-foot guest house and 343-square-foot garage proposed by Kenneth Werner at 174 Seadrift Road in the exclusive Seadrift subdivison of Stinson Beach. An existing 1,340-square-foot house will be demolished.\nWerner appealed conditions imposed by county staff to the commission, including cutting the 22.45-foot building height by two feet.

No river otter counts have been taken because the mammal is not considered endangered.\nExperts, however, suspect the comeback is linked to a 1962 ban on otter trapping; a 1972 federal law to reduce pollution in rivers, creeks, and bays; plus a series of creek cleanup and environmental restoration projects.\nScientists also believe the otter, a sleek carnivore weighing up to 31 pounds that had been hunted for its pelt, is learning how to adapt to living in the territory of humans.\n\"They were persecuted for so long by people. The trapping really hit their numbers. Now they have been adapting to us,\" said Steve Bobzien, an East Bay Regional Park District wildlife biologist who has studied large river otters in South America. \"They are charismatic, playful, and smart, and they're so cute.\"\nAs river otters became scarce or nearly vanished from the urban Bay Area, they still were commonly seen in more rural, less developed areas like the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. The otters easily swim in rivers, creeks, bays and canals, and are able to tolerate some saltwater.\nA few years ago, Isadore started noticing river otters poking their noses out of the water in Lagunitas Creek. Others have also come up from the bay and spent time in the canal, the lagoons in Corte Madera and in Corte Madera Creek, eating fish along the way. In 2011 and 2012 otters were hit and killed by cars, prompting \"otter crossing\" signs to be put up on Lucky Drive.\nThey have also turned up on docks in the San Rafael Canal and along the county's rugged West Marin coast.\nAnother otter, dubbed \"Sutro Sam,\" became a media sensation a year ago when he swam into the Sutro Baths at San Francisco's Ocean Beach and feasted on fish for several months before leaving.\nIn 2012, Isadore launched the River Otter Ecology Project  www.riverotterecology.org . The group's first order of business was to create a website with an interactive map where local \"Otter Spotters\" could chart their sightings. Since then, the once empty map has exploded with sightings throughout the Bay Area.\nEither unnoticed or gone from the Bay Area three decades ago, the otters have also been spotted in Los Gatos, Oakland, Fremont, Martinez, Walnut Creek, Richmond, Berkeley, Napa, Lafayette and elsewhere in the Bay Area.\nIn cooperation with the Point Reyes National Seashore, Muir Woods National Monument, the National Park Service, local and state parks, the otter project is monitoring 100 miles of coastline. The group's growing team of volunteers has placed more than 20 infrared, motion-sensitive cameras throughout the territory to monitor the otters' activities.\nIJ reporter Mark Prado contributed to this report\nRiver otter facts\n* Northern American river otters are sleek, agile and playful members of the weasel family that live in and along rivers, creeks, marshes and coastlines. They feast on fish and crayfish in water, and frogs, small mammals, insects and even birds on land.\n* River otters can be up to 42 inches long and weigh between 11 and 31 pounds. Males average about 25 pounds. California sea otters weigh from 31 to 99 pounds and can reach about 5 feet in length.\n* Unlike the sea otter, which is slow on land, the river otter has a different skeletal structure that allows it to walk and run quickly on land.\n* Cute as otters are, wildlife experts warn not to corner them as they have sharp teeth.\n* Although it is called a river otter, this otter can tolerate both fresh and brackish water and a variety of water temperatures.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: A river otter swims in a marsh at Big Break Regional Shoreline on Friday, Dec. 20, 2013 in Oakley, Calif.

Written by San Francisco playwright Marisela Trevi\u00d2o Orta, it's a world premiere developed within the first season of company's playwright residency program, AlterLab. The play is already a cowinner of Arizona Theatre Company's 2013 National Latino Playwriting Award (shared with Caridad Svich's \"Spark\"). This is the first time that AlterTheater has presented two plays in repertory, as Sam Shepard's \"Fool for Love\" joins this show in rotation. \"The River Bride\" will also be the first of the company's shows to go on to play American Conservatory Theater's Costume Shop Theater in San Francisco after its San Rafael run.\nBut all that is secondary to the real reason to be excited about \"The River Bride,\" which is that it's a captivating play. A Grimm-style fairy tale based on Brazilian folk tales, it's a bittersweet love story that uses poetic language and a mythic atmosphere of unreality to haunting effect. \nIt's the tale of two sisters: Belmira, the younger (an effectively exasperating Livia Demarchi), is a flighty and mercenary beauty who can't let her sister have anything without grabbing it for herself, while Helena (a touchingly soulful Carla Pauli) is stern and serious and almost cripplingly self-effacing. Belmira is about to be married to a handsome young fisherman (Adam Roy), whom she hopes will take her away from their tiny fishing village on the Amazon River where everybody knows each other and nobody has much money (or, seemingly, much use for it).\nAside from the upcoming wedding, the only real excitement in town is the sudden appearance of an immaculately well-dressed stranger (a charismatic Nick Garcia), whom the sisters' father literally fishes out of the river. This enigmatic young man, Moises (gotta love that name), is awfully vague about who he is and where he comes from, but he starts wooing the long-neglected elder sister like there's no tomorrow. Their courtship is tender and tentative and awfully sweet, gently nudged along by Helena's kind-hearted parents. (Cathleen Riddley is warm and upbeat as the insightful mother, and Matt Kizer softly amiable as the dad.) But, of course, Moises has a secret that will have to come out. Heck, everybody has secrets haunting them, and it's a question of whether or not they can successfully navigate them to find each other.\nCodirected by Ann Brebner and Jeanette Harrison, AlterTheater's production maintains the slightly dreamlike quality of a fairy tale while also achingly conveying the emotional turmoil bubbling beneath the surface, especially of Pauli's conflicted Helena. Wiljago Cook's set is just a few large wooden blocks painted pink and gray, with the barest suggestion of a dock behind them, but it effectively evokes the world of the play when combined with Selina G Young's moody blue lights and Madeleine Oldham's burbling water sounds.\nThere are some beautiful passages expressing the deep connection with the river and the timelessness of heartbreak. It's always very clear what's going on with the otherworldly element of the play and more or less where it's headed, although even then there are some surprises in store. Some of the earthly events are a little less clear, particularly regarding Belmira's engagement, but it's not really necessary to have all the blanks filled in. Orta does an admirable job with exposition in the play, having people say pretty much exactly what's going on inside them without it feeling contrived or overly repetitive. Because, as with any good fairy tale, ultimately we know that this is a story, and this is how the story is told.\nSam Hurwitt's theater blog, The Idiolect, is atwww.theidiolect.com .

After more than a decade in the making, allowing for a few more weeks for public comment is a reasonable move.\nThe time extension is the second, this time moving the deadline from Jan. 11 to Feb. 17.\nThe National Park Service's draft plan calls for limiting the trails and beaches in the GGNRA where dogs would be allowed to romp without being held by a leash. In Marin, the draft plan would require dogs to be on leash at Muir Beach.\nThe GGNRA's 2011 plan, which was never implemented and is now being revised, had banned dogs from the beach.\nCurrently, dogs are allowed off-leash, but under voice command.\nThat's the way it should be, according to many dog owners, who say letting dogs run off-leash is part of their enjoyment of the parkland.\nThey haven't gotten much support from park officials and environmentalists, who say that leashes are necessary as a safety measure and to protect the park's sensitive wildlife areas.\nDog owners have already succeeded in their legal challenge of the 2011 rules and forced GGNRA to almost re-boot its process.\nExtending the deadline is a wise move, especially in response to one of the biggest complaints about the 2011 rules.\nThe park service, in its latest draft plan, demonstrated its willingness to come up with a plan that was less sweeping and more reflective of different areas and uses in the many and varied park opportunities GGNRA's 80,000 acres have to offer.\nThe difference between Point Reyes National Seashore or the Muir Woods National Monument and GGNRA is that Golden Gate was established as a \"recreation\" area. To many people, exercising their dogs is part of the recreation regimen. A change in the rules should be based on facts and science.\nThe park service, in its latest draft, is showing an interest in accommodating that activity in many parts of the park. The goal of the draft plan is to also respond to concerns about safety and environmental protection.\nThere should be a fair process that leads to a reasonable solution.\nThe debate is politically charged. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution opposing the draft plan, calling it \"progressive dimunition\" of public access.\nLast month, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, asked park officials to extend the comment period and reminded officials about off-leash areas that people enjoyed before the land in San Francisco was transferred from the city into GGNRA.\nThe extension provides the public more time to detail their support, opposition and questions about proposed changes.\nThose comments and concerns deserve to be part of a process that should be open, fair and deliberative.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Unleashed dogs play in the surf on Friday, Jan. 14, 2011, in Muir Beach, Calif.

Magnetic north. Grid north. These directional terms are important for explorers, sailors and pretty much anyone who needs to use a map to get where he or she's going. If you're going for pizza, True North will take you to San Anselmo's newest pizza restaurant.\n\"It's a fun, familiar name,\" says owner Buck Minitch. Minitch, who spent eight years in the Marine Corps, is also intimately familiar with the many usages of \"north.\" Taking advantage of a double entendre, True North Artisan Pizza & Craft Beer uses the North Pole, or the North Star, Polaris, as a guide in its pizza philosophy and design. \nCompass-enabled or not, pizza fans will find well-made pizza at True North Artisan Pizza, which opened Nov. 1, in the space that was briefly Zio Pizza, before that, Lo Coco's. Many of the menu items are from Lo Coco's menu (Minitch has Lo Coco's recipes), and many dishes like the Caesar salad ($5) and garlic bread ($5) are the same as they once were.\nMinitch tweaked Lo Coco's crust recipe and, though he would not reveal any ingredients or cooking techniques (leaving one to wonder, what is true pizza?), the crust seemed to be a bit softer and stretchier than under previous ownership. The house crust is the foundation of many items, including the garlic bread and the bruschetta ($7). Shaped and served like a mini-pizza, the bruschetta boasted beautiful, sweet tomatoes, brightened with fresh basil. Pizzas are small (10 inches, $14) or large (14 inches, $22). Our combo arrived with a blistered crust, had a soft, subtle crunch and a pleasant chew.\nNot so the gluten-free pizza. Though Minitch assured me that he has taken steps to correct the problem, the crust on the gluten-free pizza I ordered was so firm, it was difficult to chew and left me with an achy jaw. Minitch and his chefs developed their own gluten-free crust, and take pains to ensure these pizzas are prepared and cooked separately from gluten-bearing pizzas. Perhaps now, post-revision, the cooking method produces more favorable results.\nTrue North also has calzones ($12, meat or veggie) and pasta, such as the penne sienna ($14), topped with a luscious cream and pesto-infused red sauce, but pizza is the name of the game here. An expanded menu of barbecue ribs and wings, hot dogs, wienerschnitzel, sliders and soup is expected shortly.\nWith a guiding motto of \"no beers owned or made by Coors, Miller or Bud,\" Minitch is developing a craft beer program to pair with the pizzas. A few familiar names are here among the 20 or so beers, such as Napa Smith pale ale (12 ounces, $5) and Abita amber (12 ounces, $5) but as the list grows to 70, including 10 draft beers (permit pending), expect more unique choices like the Nectar Humboldt brown hemp ale (12 ounces, $5). A short list of wines, all $7 a glass or $28 for a bottle, and a few ciders ($5 to $15) round out the list.\nWorn red booths still line the walls, but True North's single, large room has undergone a bit of remodeling. The rafters are gone, exposing a girder ceiling that resembles a bridge's latticework. Photos of bridges hang from the freshly painted red walls. The lighting, redone by Minitch, features small bulbs hung from long cables. You could say the pinpoint lighting resembles stars, but that might be stretching the star metaphor a bit too far.\nHalf the room has smaller caf\u00c8 tables, turned to watch the musician strumming a guitar in the corner. Live music six nights a week and at Sunday brunch adds bounce, enlivening the room. The atmosphere is convivial. Kids and parents might get up to dance or to chat with Minitch and the musicians. Some switch seats after dining to listen more attentively.\nRefusing to be pinned down by pizza style, True North's philosophy can best be summed up by the experience. Well-made pizza and small batch beer go well together. Throw in some live music that entertains the kids and relaxes the adults and you have yourself a party. Once the sun and a few beers go down, those lights may become stars after all.\nChristina Mueller writes about food   restaurants, chefs, products and trends   for local and national publications as well as other industry clients.

Marin Municipal Water District should follow suit.\nWhy is the board delaying action in imposing prudent rationing?\nWhat we're seeing is unprecedented, extreme variation in seasonal weather patterns. Couple that with the fact that Marin has vastly more residents than it did during the previously worst recorded drought of 1929. In that year, Marin tallied almost twice as much water (19 inches) than our county received for the entire calendar year of 2013 (10.68 inches).\nObviously we have a reservoir system now that we didn't back then.\nBut still Marin is in a chronic deficit position in regard to water, importing 25 percent annually from Sonoma. \nWouldn't it be prudent to act now, so the rationing is less painful later?\nWhat can the MMWD board be thinking (or contemplating)?\nHow do its directors see themselves and their mission? Are they public resource stewards? Businessmen? Or poker players   holding the desal plant construction card? And in what combination?\nOh my, they have us guessing.\nPeter Hensel, Corte Madera\n'Forward-looking action'\nA significant number of Marin residents have no experience of life under a severe water rationing scenario.\nFor those of us who well remember 1976-77, it's a huge inconvenience.\nIt is admirable that Marin Municipal Water District is not overreacting with early rationing and is making a public relations effort to reduce use now.\nBut we are about halfway through January with nary a drop. Unless we have a February or March \"miracle,\" we are headed into a very rough water year.\nWater dependent businesses, like restaurants, will be especially hard hit if we have to eventually go to 25 percent rationing.\nTo ease or delay this possibility to the maximum extent possible, instead of waiting for April, the district should consider an early phased-in rationing approach to begin to condition adults and children alike.\nIf January remains dry, the district should consider an immediate mandatory 10 percent cutback on residential use.\nAs we learned previously, water is a finite resource, and rationing is an education process, so an earlier start is advantageous for many good reasons.\nFor commercial users, the district could consider a water credit incentive program to reduce year-to-year comparative consumption.\nFor example, for every commercial cubic-foot savings under voluntary reductions now, to help ease their burden, commercial users could earn a double credit, should widespread rationing be required later this year.\nIf significant rain does appear and early-year rationing can be curtailed, few if any would fault the directors for being proactive by taking early, forward-looking action.\nLarry Minikes, San Rafael\nReason for caution\nIt won't take a visit from Punxsutawney Phil to tell us that Marin County is in for a hard drought this year.\nI walk Mount Tamalpais a few times a week and I can see and feel the dry winds and the warmth of a high pressure system settling in above our area. It's shown little willingness to move east.\nThe beauty is marred only by the ever-spreading gray of dead shrubs and young trees that aren't getting enough water this year. I hope those who join me up on the mountain will remain ever vigilant and forthright when confronted by the possible fire dangers.\nI was raised in the Santa Monica Mountains and I have seen a small spark turn into a raging inferno that's burned down whole neighborhoods, killed pets and ruined the lives of thousands.\nWe should practice good citizenship by remembering to carry our cellphone in case we see a fire.\nLet's be be careful out there.\nJohn Thomas Ellis, Kentfield\nSAN ANSELMO\nObeying the rules\nDick Spotswood writes in his Jan. 8 column that Ford Greene was not selected as mayor of San Anselmo by his colleagues because he \"rubbed some colleagues the wrong way last time he held the mayor's gavel.\"\nThe actual reasons why the San Anselmo Town Council chose not to select him as its mayor at its Dec. 10 meeting are contained in the recording of that meeting, which is available to the public (including IJ columnists) athttp://www.sanhub.com/ .\nThe reasons discussed related to the fact that Mr. Greene has an ongoing fight with the town in which he is appealing a unanimous decision by the Planning Commission. The commission affirmed a town staff decision, rejecting Mr. Greene's arguments that, unlike all other properties in town, state and local fire and building codes should not apply to his basement living unit.\nIndeed, as stated at the meeting, Mr. Greene told at least one of the council members that he will sue the town in federal court should his effort to avoid having these laws apply to him fail.\nThe council members indicated that, in light of his adverse position to the town and its staff and his threatened litigation against them, it was not in the town's best interests to select him as its top leader and spokesperson.\nThis decision seems reasonable and in the best interests of the town.\nWould Mr. Spotswood, a former Mill Valley elected official, have selected as his mayor someone who was in the midst of a personal financial dispute with the city and was planning to sue.\nMany people do not realize that the mayor position is largely ceremonial and is a privilege earned by members of local councils for the work they do and the examples they set as public servants.\nCarla Overberger, San Anselmo, Former Planning Commissioner\nenvironment\nAppreciation for leashes\nI love going to the beach and watching dogs run loose and play. I generally like dogs but don't have one, so for me this is a nice way to enjoy them.\nI'm also an avid hiker and mountain biker, and enjoy exploring the fabulous trails we have here locally and elsewhere.\nWhenever I have encountered an unleashed dog on a single track hiking trail my first instinct is to prepare to defend myself. This is because I have no way of knowing whether the dog is going to be aggressive or not, and we are both going to have to be in close proximity to one another due to the narrow space available on the trail.\nThis is quite different than being on a wide open beach, or in a dog park.\nHaving been attacked twice by aggressive dogs, including being bitten by a friend's dogs at their home, I hate to say it, but I am somewhat fearful now when I encounter unleashed dogs.\nIs this the way dog owners want others to respond to their beloved four-legged friends?\nLeash your dog in the parks, unless there is open space for them to romp, and spare the rest of us from having to wonder whether we are about to be attacked.\nTom Short, San Rafael\nNATIONAL POLITICS\nExperience counts\nI'm just not convinced that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is the right person to send to Washington to solve gridlock.\nRandy Warren, San Rafael", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 15"}, {"relevance": [213.0], "text": "Wednesday's local events\nHIGH SCHOOL BOYS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nMarin Catholic vs. Branson           7:30 p.m.           COM\nHIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nMarin Catholic vs. Branson           6 p.m.           COM\nThursday's local events \nCOLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nCOM at Contra Costa           7:30 p.m.           San Pablo\nCOLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nCOM at Contra Costa           5:30 p.m.           San Pablo\nHIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nMarin Academy at Sacred Heart           5:30 p.m.           San Francisco\nON THE AIR WednesDAY\nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL           Time           TV           Radio\nAuburn at Tennessee           4 p.m.           CSNCA\nNotre Dame at Maryland           4 p.m.           ESPN2\nSouth Florida at SMU           4 p.m.           ESPNU\nBaylor at Texas Tech           6 p.m.           ESPNU\nLSU at Mississippi           6 p.m.           CSNCA\nWashington State at Stanford           7 p.m.           P12BA           1050 AM\nWashington at Cal           8 p.m.           ESPNU           810 AM\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL           Time           TV           Radio\nCollegiate Bowl Practice           10 a.m.           ESPNU\nCollegiate Bowl Practice           1 p.m.           ESPNU\nGOLF           Time           TV           Radio\nHSBC Championship           1 a.m.           Golf\nNBA           Time           TV           Radio\nUtah at San Antonio           5 p.m.           ESPN\nDenver at Golden State           7:30 p.m.           ESPN, CSN           680 AM\nNHL           Time           TV           Radio\nWashington at Pittsburgh           5 p.m.           NBCS\nSOCCER           Time           TV           Radio\nEPL: Fulham vs Sunderland           8 p.m.           CSNCA*\nTENNIS           Time           TV           Radio\nAustralian Open: Second Round           noon           ESPN2*\nAustralian Open: Second Round           6 p.m.           ESPN2\nAustralian Open: Second Round           midnight           ESPN2\nON THE AIR ThursDAY\nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL           Time           TV           Radio\nWhiparound Coverage           3:30 p.m.           ESPNU\nBelmont at Eastern Kentucky           4 p.m.           ESPNU\nConnecticut at Memphis           4 p.m.           ESPN\nMissouri at Vanderbilt           4 p.m.           ESPN2\nUCLA at Colorado           5 p.m.           P12BA\nBYU at San Francisco           6 p.m.           ESPNU\nOhio State at Minnesota           6 p.m.           ESPN2\nGonzaga at Pepperdine           7 p.m.           CSN\nUSC at Utah           7 p.m.           P12BA\nLong Beach State at UCSB           8 p.m.           ESPNU\nNBA           Time           TV           Radio\nNew York at Indiana           4 p.m.           TNT\nOklahoma City at Houston           6:30 p.m.           TNT\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL           Time           TV           Radio\nCollegiate Bowl practice           10 a.m.           ESPNU\nCollegiate Bowl practice           1 p.m.           ESPNU\nGOLF           Time           TV           Radio\nHumana Challenge           noon           Golf\nAbu Dhabi Championship           1 a.m. (Fri.)

Delicious. Delectable. The deviled egg. This eggscellent hors d'oeuvre is making its way from the picnic table to the silver tray. Kathy Casey's \"D'Lish Deviled Eggs: A Collection of Recipes from Creative to Classic,\" is an ode to the egg and its rise in appetizer ranks.\nCasey begins with a brief history of the egg and how-tos on preparing and piping. Then she gives us \"egg-ceptional ideas\" for how to serve deviled eggs at every holiday meal of the year, including Eggs Benedict Day (April 16) and World Egg Day (Oct. 11). She also makes recipe suggestions for events from the regal (weddings) to restrained (summer picnics). \nThis impressive collection of more than 50 recipes includes everything from international cuisine like firecracker barbecue pork and Thai curry-spiced deviled eggs with shrimp to American standards like retro shrimp cocktail, red hot buffalo and bacon cheddar, to interesting like corned beef and sauerkraut, devilish green eggs and ham, and pumpkin pie deviled eggs.\nLooking for a recipe to prepare, I skipped the classics like grandma's old-fashioned and went for the sophisticated   deviled quail eggs and caviar. Inventive, but expensive. I also chose the intriguing, budget-friendly Indian curry. The recipe was easy to follow and the cumin and mango chutney in the egg were delicious.\nThe dirty martini and bloody Mary recipes each called for alcohol. I was cooking in the morning so I prepared the bloody Mary. The recipe calls for the horseradish, Worcestershire, celery seeds to be mixed with the mayonnaise and yolk, leaving the veggies and vodka for the topping. Delicious.\nAnother favorite was the smoked salmon with sour cream and chives. It was easy to make and elegant on the table.\n\"D'Lish Deviled Eggs\" proves the deviled egg is more than an old appetizer making a retro comeback. It is an art form.\nRECIPES\nBloody Mary deviled eggs\nMakes 24 deviled eggs\nFilling\n\u03a9 cup mayonnaise\n1 tablespoon prepared horseradish\n1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce\n\u03a9 teaspoon Tabasco sauce\n\u00ba teaspoon celery seeds\n\u00ba teaspoon salt\nTopping\n\u03a9 cup tiny diced tomatoes\n2 tablespoons minced celery\n4 teaspoons minced pimento-stuffed green olives\n1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice\n2 teaspoon vodka\nHalve the eggs lengthwise and transfer the yolks to a mixing bowl. Set the egg white halves on a platter, cover and refrigerate.\nWith a fork, mash the yolks to a smooth consistency. Add the mayonnaise, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, celery seeds and salt, and mix until smooth. (You can also do this using an electric mixer with a whip attachment.)

The court then has discretion to schedule the matter for a felony jury trial later this year.\nRichards, described by Sheriff Bob Doyle as \"a model prisoner,\" has been a county jail resident since he was captured in the Philippines last summer on a federal fugitive warrant.\nIn the criminal justice system it's always possible that a pre-trial plea bargain will be reached between District Attorney Ed Berberian's office and Richards. \nThe former sewer honcho is charged with absconding with $339,000 of district funds.\nIf Richards is found guilty or cops a plea, in addition to a period of incarceration followed by probation, it's likely that a court will order that he make restitution for the missing cash.\nMarin's recent history of these orders actually resulting in full restitution to defrauded public entities is mixed.\nExample one is the curious case of Richard Mollenkopf.\nIn 1990, Mollenkopf was the well-regarded chief of the Ross Valley Fire Service. His arrest came as a huge shock.\nThe fire chief was charged with a series of bizarre actions, including a bomb plot and embezzlement of public funds.\nSentenced to state prison, Mollenkopf was order to pay Ross Valley Fire Service $408,730 along with $55,262 in costs plus interest.\nEven after being forced to sell his real property, the disgraced fire chief still owed Ross Valley Fire a six-figure sum.\nOver two decades, Mollenkopf's debt has been accruing interest at 10 percent compounded annually. The fire service's administration estimated last year that the debt now totals $696,745.\nProspects of collection appear dim even though criminal restitution orders are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.\nThe failure to collect Mollenkopf's debt isn't due to inadvertence. Two former Ross Valley Fire Service directors, former Fairfax mayor Frank Egger and retired San Anselmo Mayor Paul Chignell never gave up the chase. San Anselmo Councilman Ford Greene also is pushing collection. To this day, they all remain determined that the restitution judgment be fully honored.\nEgger, in his current role as a Ross Valley Sanitary District director, knows from this experience that a restitution order is no guarantee that Brett Richards will ever make the public's treasury whole.\nThat's especially true given that Richards, unlike Mollenkopf owns no traceable real estate or other assets that Ross Valley Sanitary District might attach to settle his debt.\nThat may be the greatest irony.\nRichards' unsecured loan of taxpayers' funds, the subject of all of his travails, was made for \"housing.\" According to the DA's quite thorough forensic accountant, instead of buying real property, that in the current resurgent economy would likely have soared in value, Richards illegally frittered away most of his allegedly ill-gained loot on overseas trips and high living.\nOf course Richards, who has pleaded not guilty, could be acquitted. Even in that event the money is still gone and collection prospects remain slim.\nlll\nI RECENTLY WROTE that because of a redistricting quirk, Marin hasn't been represented in the California state Senate since 2012.

Board president Natu Tuatagaloa said district staff will be directed to investigate the matter further.\nEstavillo, who holds a doctor of education degree from Harvard University, became the Bahia Vista principal prior to the 2012-13 school year. She joined the district in 2007 as a teacher at San Pedro Elementary School. Estavillo did not respond to multiple phone messages seeking comment.\nThe school district declined comment on the matter in an email from Superintendent Michael Watenpaugh's office: \"Because this is a personnel matter, it is a privacy issue for San Rafael City Schools. As a district, we are required to protect the confidentiality and rights of both students and staff; therefore, we are unable to comment in any way at this time.\"\nSeveral other school officials and staff, including Tuatagaloa, trustee Paul Cohen and teachers association president Kay O'Donnell, did not respond to inquiries from the Independent Journal.\nThe claim that Estavillo \"has shown a lack of willingness to speak with students and parents\" was supported during the board meeting by five Bahia Vista parents who spoke during the meeting's public comment period. Three of the parents spoke Spanish, and had their comments translated into English for the trustees.\nThey described interactions with the principal, in which they approached Estavillo to discuss problems involving their children. But they said Estavillo showed limited interest or ability to address the issues. One mother said she felt like she had to teach the principal how to help her son.\nThe claims are in stark contrast to the praise Estavillo received from the district when she was promoted. In a 2012 press release announcing Estavillo's appointment, she was lauded for being well qualified for the job.\n\"Gloria's professional experience, her personal attributes, and her familiarity with the district and greater San Rafael community, represent the essential skills and talents that are highly desired in our leaders for San Rafael City Schools, and are exceptionally well matched for Bahia Vista,\" the statement read.\nContact Laith Agha via email atlagha@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Gloria Estavillo is pictured in April of 2012 after she was named principal at Bahia Vista School in San Rafael.

The April ruling overturned a lower court decision from 2009 that sided with Equity LifeStyle Properties, stating the city's ordinance constituted a government \"taking\" of private property. \nCity Attorney Rob Epstein said the decisions made by the circuit court and Supreme Court once and for all affirm the validity of the city's law   even if it took a huge chunk of time to do so.\n\"I don't think anyone could have anticipated when this case began that it would take this long for it to conclude. I don't think the city ever thought this fight was going to be easy, but 14 years is an unusually long time for litigation,\" Epstein said.\nMayor Gary Phillips said he's happy the Supreme Court has effectively ended further time spent in court on the issue.\n\"We anticipated that would be their ruling and we're quite pleased it has come to a conclusion,\" Phillips said.\nLandowner Equity LifeStyle Properties said the Supreme Court's decision won't help new tenants moving into Contempo Marin.\n\"The trial court found after a full trial that the city's rent control ordinance does not make housing more affordable, a conclusion the court of appeals did not dispute and the Supreme Court did not review. Instead, the ordinance forces new residents to pay more up front to get into the community than they would have to pay without the ordinance. Our customers are overwhelmingly satisfied with the quality and pricing of the communities and lifestyle we provide without the need for rent control,\" said Equity LifeStyle Properties spokeswoman Jennifer Ludovice in a statement.\nBut most homeowners are happy with the outcome of the case and plan to attend a future City Council meeting en masse to express their gratitude.\nKeith Meloney, president of the Contempo Marin Homeowners Association, said he's thankful to the city for standing behind its ordinance and protecting Contempo Marin residents.\n\"This case comes to a final close and it lands where residents who have purchased properties can enjoy the same benefit others enjoy. We recaptured equity preservation,\" Meloney said. \"Our buyers will be buying rent-controlled property and therefore our equity is able to be recovered.\"\nWhile Contempo Marin residents own their homes, they lease space from Equity LifeStyle Properties. The city's ordinance, enacted in 1989, is meant to keep the mobile home park affordable.\nIn 1993 and 1999 the ordinance underwent revisions that made it so the park's owners couldn't increase rents beyond 75 percent of the change in housing prices per the Consumer Price Index. It also gave new residents moving onto a vacant pad in the park the right to rent the space at the same rate as the previous tenant.\nMeloney said the 2009 ruling siding with the landowner devastated the community by allowing the owner to increase rents to nearly $2,000 a month   triple what he had been paying   hurting resale value of the homes and causing more than 70 people to abandon their residences and mortgages.\nHe said the property company knew it was buying rent-controlled land, so why it sought to challenge that fact remains a mystery.\n\"They bought a regulated piece of land at a regulated price level,\" Meloney said.\nThe argument over rent began in 2000 when the park sued the city, claiming the ordinance unfairly targeted them and caused them to lose 81 percent of the value of the community by disallowing rent increases. A settlement was reached in July 2001, but residents urged the City Council to back out of it, prompting the park's owner to add to the suit accusations that the city breached the settlement agreement.\nIn November 2002, a jury ruled in favor of the city on the settlement issue, but it held off on other matters pending a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a case involving the oil industry.\nIn August 2004, the park's owner filed a second lawsuit seeking monetary damages. The district court dismissed the complaint in December 2006, stating the company had already waived its monetary damages as part of the first lawsuit.\nIn May 2005, the Supreme Court ruled on the oil industry case, shooting down a theory about regulatory takings that had been the basis of the park company's claim. The company amended its complaint in February 2006.\nAfter a second bench trial in May 2007, the district court issued a final judgment in 2009 favoring the company. The city opted to seek appellate review and won its appeal in April 2013.\nDespite feelings of elation with the Supreme Court decision, Meloney said residents are concerned about what the property owner might do next.\n\"They've made plenty of threats about closing the park if they lose the lawsuit,\" Meloney said. \"Now we see.\"\nEpstein said he's aware of those threats, but the city hasn't focused on or investigated the landowner's next steps. He said closing the park would suggest the property owner wants to do something else with the land, requiring a potential change in zoning.\n\"If such a proposal came, we'd evaluate it at that time,\" Epstein said.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

Within the past week the nonprofit has launched a new program aimed at making connections in San Rafael. \nNarayan Khalsa, 26, and Ben Dougherty, 20, have been hired by the nonprofit to canvass places like Boyd Memorial Park for homeless young people. Both are making the transition out of homelessness themselves and looking for ways to help other young adults do the same.\n\"At this stage we're just trying to talk to them and develop some kind of relationship and let them know what's out there,\" Khalsa said. \"It's hard to develop trust with people.\"\nThe idea behind the program, which was created by Khalsa and two other formerly homeless youths involved with the nonprofit, is that homeless young people will be more responsive to generational peers, especially those who have walked in their shoes.\nDougherty said so far the effort has been viewed favorably.\n\"They've welcomed us more warmly than we've anticipated,\" Dougherty said. \"They've been open with us about changes they want in their lives.\"\nThus far the two men have met young homeless people who want to improve their lives, but are having trouble finding jobs because of their criminal records. The lack of affordable housing and not having a stable place to live were also listed as barriers.\nThose who want to help themselves and meet other homeless youths are encouraged to attend weekly meetings at Ambassadors of Hope and Opportunity's new San Rafael office, next to Saint Raphael Church on Fifth Avenue. There Zara Babitzke, the nonprofit's founder and executive director, helps them obtain an assortment of services ranging from haircuts to transitional housing.\nBut Babitzke said it's the young people who really help each other by creating an emotionally supportive environment where people can share their troubles and feel supported.\n\"They really take care of one another,\" Babitzke said.\nOne 20-year-old homeless man who attends the nonprofit's meetings and has been helped by Babitzke said the program is a great idea, and he hopes to become involved.\n\"It takes somebody who lived it. You can't just approach somebody and say 'Hey I can smell you from around the block, you might be homeless, let's talk,'\" he said.\nThe College of Marin student has been homeless for about a year and wished to remain anonymous. He said his parents kicked him out of the house when he graduated high school.\nWith no home and nothing to do, he began to drink alcohol in large quantities during the summer, but said he has since stopped. When he's unable to find a couch to sleep on, he will walk all night to stay awake and then sleep in local parks during the safer daylight hours.\n\"It's frightening. I've stayed in post office lobbies that are open 24 hours because its warm,\" he said.\nFormerly homeless nonprofit participant James Hayes, 30, can relate. He became homeless at 18 when he aged out of a group home. But now he has a stable place to live, a job, is taking college courses and still attending meetings with other participants in the program.\nHayes credits Babitzke and her supportive nonprofit with helping him succeed.\n\"If you don't have support in your life, it's very hard to be in this situation and move forward,\" Hayes said. \"We're like somebody's second parent, helping them navigate rental agreements and things like that. We help people get back on their feet.\"\nFormerly homeless participant Sam Laidig, 21, agreed.\n\"We're like a connector, an operator. AHO exists more for people to access resources,\" Laidig said.\nAfter going to college for a year and dropping out, Laidig said he became homeless after experiencing conflicts with his parents.\n\"I have pretty severe depression that can give me anxiety attacks,\" Laidig said. \"It killed my motivation to do anything.\"\nAfter couch surfing for many months, the nonprofit helped him find a place to live, paying for the first few months of rent. It's been 18 months since then and he now has a job.\nWhile the San Rafael program is still in its fledgling stages, Babitzke said the hope is the team will help the nonprofit reach an additional 200 new participants each year beyond the 150 people the nonprofit serves on an ongoing basis for up to five years.\nSupport group participant Lindsay Rucker, 28, said she knows what it's like to be young, lost and not have any support. The precariously housed Rucker said the nonprofit's networking services and social support system have helped her greatly   and she hopes it can help others.\n\"It does help me strengthen my own confidence and ways to get around in this world,\" Rucker said.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

But Tuesday the court denied the request.\nNone of the judges of the Appeals Court requested a vote on whether to rehear the case. Lunny's next legal move is unknown at this point.\nLunny was seeking a temporary injunction from the court to allow him to continue to operate until his lawsuit challenging the closure can be heard. Until legal issues are cleared up, the Inverness oyster farm remains open.\nThe closure order came on Nov. 29, 2012, when Salazar announced he would allow a 40-year lease   originally negotiated with the Johnson Oyster Co. in 1972 and taken on by Drakes Bay   to expire. In 1972, the federal government bought the land from Johnson for $79,200 and provided the lease. Lunny took over the lease in 2004.\nSalazar wrote in his decision that Lunny was explicitly informed \"no new permit will be issued\" after the 2012 expiration date.\nThis story will be updated.\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Kevin Lunny looks out at his workers processing oysters as his son Sean pushes a hand truck full of oysters at Drakes Bay Oyster company in Point Reyes National Seashore, Calif.

Hikers with dogs, and all equestrians and bicyclists, will not be allowed to venture off roads and trails.\nThe department said its revised plan will outline a public process it will employ to designate the official road and trail system. Under the program, existing roads and trails that do not become part of the designated system will be closed as time allows. In the meantime, only \"pedestrians\" will be permitted to use them.\n\"During the public process related to designation of the road and trail system, the retention of redundant roads and trails may be considered to separate trail users,\" the department added. The old plan indicated \"redundant\" routes were destined for closure.\nIn addition, the new policy recognizes \"social trails\" as separate from the designated system of trails and describes circumstances under which they may continue, according to the brief overview released by parks officials.\nThe plan, its provisions and revisions will be reviewed by the Marin County Parks and Open Space Commission at 2:30 p.m. Jan. 23 at the Civic Center.\nOther changes include:\n* Plans that in some cases called for a \"ratio\" program doubling or accelerating trail closures in regions where new trails are created have been dropped. \"As part of the public process to designate the future road and trail system, each existing road and trail will be assigned a score,\" according to the parks department. \"Among other input, these scores will help inform whether a road or trail becomes part of the designated system and, if so, whether a road or trail will be improved, converted, or rerouted to reduce its impact. If a trail does not become part of the designated system, it will be decommissioned.\"\n* The number of \"visitor zones\" set up by the plan was reduced, and the zones renamed. The new names: Conservation area, a designation covering 73 percent of all open space acreage; sensitive resource area, 16 percent of all open space acreage; and impacted area, or 11 percent of all open space acreage.\nWhile key revisions will be released Thursday via the web posting, other revisions including those to improve clarity will appear in a version of the plan scheduled for release this spring.\nFollowing a firestorm of protest and confusion, parks officials pledged to redouble efforts explaining what the draft trails and roads plan does   and doesn't do.\nThe plan makes protection of the environment a top priority while posing restrictions that include shutting wayward trails and old roads. It envisions a network of official paths and restricts activities including off-leash dogs, off-trail jaunts and mountain bike racing.\nBecause there are many \"redundant\" trails crisscrossing 16,000 acres of county parkland, some eventually may be shut following public review.\n\"It is a draft plan,\" Supervisor Steve Kinsey noted last month. \"We're paying attention and we'll make changes.\"\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

Similar high-pressure zones pop up all the time during most winters, but they usually break down, allowing rain to get through to California. This one, ominously, has anchored itself for 13 months, since December 2012, making it unprecedented in modern weather records, leaving researchers scratching their heads. \n\"It's like the Sierra   a mountain range just sitting off the West Coast   only bigger,\" said Bob Benjamin, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Monterey. \"This ridge is sort of a mountain in the atmosphere. In most years, it comes and goes. This year it came and didn't go.\"\nThe current high-pressure ridge is even stronger and more persistent than a similar ridge that parked over the Pacific Ocean during the 1976-77 drought, one of the driest in the 20th century.\nThe result was a record low 10.68 inches of rain in 2013 at Lake Lagunitas, where the Marin Municipal Water District   which has data dating to 1879   keeps its official weather gauge. The previous record low in Marin was set in 1929 when 19.06 inches of rain fell. The annual average is 52 inches per year.\nScientists know that changes in temperature cause high- and low-pressure zones around the world. In many ways, air works like water. The deeper you swim in the ocean, the stronger the water pressure, because the weight of the water above is pressing down on the water below. Air in the atmosphere also has weight, and as temperatures of the ocean and land fluctuate, the atmospheric pressure also changes, helping drive much of our weather.\nWhat researchers don't know, however, is why the current high-pressure ridge is so persistent, or when it is going away, allowing California to enjoy some much-needed rain. A few scientists say that it may be related to climate change, but nobody knows for sure.\n\"I wish I had a really good answer for this,\" said Daniel Cayan, an oceanographer and atmospheric scientist with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. \"It's unusual for the pattern to have not broken down to allow some relatively active, vigorous winter storm systems to track across California.\"\nWith each passing week, California's lack of rainfall becomes more serious.\nLast year was the driest calendar year in recorded history in California in most cities, with records going back 160 years. The first snowpack reading in the Sierra Nevada earlier this month found a snowpack of just 20 percent of normal.\nMeanwhile, Marin Municipal Water District reservoirs are 55 percent full; normally they are 77 percent at this time. Major reservoirs in Shasta and Oroville are each 36 percent full, about half of normal for this time of year. San Luis Reservoir near Los Banos is 30 percent full, 42 percent of normal. Major Bay Area water agencies haven't yet called for mandatory summer water restrictions but are expected to make the decision in the next month or two, depending largely on whether the high-pressure ridge breaks down and rain falls.\nState Department of Water Resources Director Mark Cowin told members of the California State Board of Food and Agriculture in Sacramento a week ago that his agency is likely to recommend that Gov. Jerry Brown declare a drought by Feb. 1, which would make it easier for water transfers between agencies and for emergency loans and other assistance.\nOn Monday at a news conference in Fresno, Brown told reporters, \"It's coming. Just be patient.''\nStill, he said last week: \"Governors can't make it rain.\"\nSince July 1, Marin has received 3.79 inches of rain   just 16 percent of normal; San Francisco has received 2.1 inches of rain, or 20 percent of normal; San Jose has received 1.57 inches, or 26 percent of normal; and Oakland has received 2.08 inches, or 22 percent of normal.\nAll is not lost. Experts note that California still has another two or three months left in its winter season.\n\"In California, most of our water in the reservoirs comes from just a handful of big storms each winter,\" said Daniel Swain, a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University in the Department of Environmental Earth System Science who coined the term \"Ridiculously Resilient Ridge\" on his blog,weatherwest.com .\n\"If we do manage to get a few decent storms, we could definitely get enough water to stave off the worst consequences of a really extreme water shortage,\" he said. \"But if we don't, we've essentially lost the whole water year.\"\nFor anyone concocting plans to set up giant fans or other schemes to get rid of the ridge, meteorologists say that's impossible. The energy in weather systems is greater than the energy in nuclear bombs, they remind us.\nFor at least the next week, the National Weather Service forecasts a few occasional sprinkles but no major storms and no breakdown in the ridge.\n\"We've had a few weather systems come through,\" said Leslie Wanek, a meteorologist in Salt Lake City at the regional headquarters of the National Weather Service. \"But it just keeps rebuilding there. It's kind of a mystery about why. Why is the global atmospheric pattern stuck like this?\"\nIJ reporter Mark Prado contributed to this report.\nfire weather\nA red flag warning is in effect in the North Bay through Thursday morning as a combination of factors including low humidity increases fire danger.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Andrew Bowman carries his bicycle around a closed gate at Sky Oaks Ranger Station on Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2014, near Fairfax, Calif.

Tissue Banks will now move its San Rafael operations to a building in Richmond, which it has purchased.\n\"It's two to three times larger than the building in San Rafael,\" Thrush said.\nTissue Bank's San Rafael facility was one of the largest musculosketal tissue processing centers in Northern California. Thousands of musculosketal tissue donations and corneas were stored there each year.\nTendons, skin, femurs and eyes   gathered from deceased local organ and tissue donors   were dispatched to Tissue Bank's San Rafael location. Their technicians, some of whom are physicians from overseas, prepared the tissues in specially filtered \"clean rooms.\" The tissue was stored in freezers prior to delivery to doctors, hospitals and medical device companies.\nIn its 2012 tax filing, Tissue Banks reported $45.6 million in total revenue and an excess of revenue over expenses of about $1 million. Thrush said the company has more than 200 employees nationwide. In addition to California, the nonprofit has offices in eight other states. San Rafael was its largest facility.\nSan Rafael City Manager Nancy Mackle said, \"We are always sorry to lose a local business to another city. Our economic development staff works with the chamber to conduct business retention interviews with a sample of businesses each year to identify needs, but most often we hear they are leaving after the decision is made, not before.\"\nRobert Eyler, CEO of the Marin Economic Forum and a professor at Sonoma State University, said, \" I don't think there is any reason to hit the panic button or to think this is a signal of a major out-migration of these type of businesses.\n\"It's just a sign that our commercial space is relatively restricted in terms of breadth,\" he said, \" and when a business like this needs to triple in size it is difficult to find a property to suit their needs in Marin County.\"\nArthur Manseau, the owner of the San Rafael building that Tissue Banks is vacating, said Tissue Banks spent $5 million upgrading the 1980s structure so it could accommodate the nonprofits' formidable electricity needs.\n\"BioMarin could easily move in,\" Manseau said.\nBioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. announced in December that it has signed an agreement to purchase the San Rafael Corporate Center for $116.5 million to accommodate its growth needs.\nContact Richard Halstead via e-mail atrhalstead@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: A Tissue Banks International technician works in one of the organization's clean rooms in San Rafael, Calif. on Thursday, June 30, 2011.

They are trying to raise money for the trip and have set up a fund at the Rosie the Riveter Trust, P.O. Box 71126, Richmond, CA, 94807. Donations should specify that they are for the trip to Washington D.C.\nGould calls it all \"a bit of a fairy tale,\" referring to the personal phone call from Biden and his invitation.\nCertainly, it's a long way from the grueling hours she spent working as a welder at the Kaiser shipyards in 1942.\nGould and other women were recruited because the United States needed workers to help build ships. They were breaking males-only union rules and, for a short time, needed to be escorted by chaperones to and from their jobs.\nGould stayed on the job until V-J Day ended the war in August 1945. She \"retired\" from the shipyards and returned home, where she raised five children.\nGould's trip to Washington, she says, will be recognition for the many women who worked in defense jobs. \"Everybody was doing something,\" she said of the war effort.\nThe 1942 poster showed a woman wearing a red polka-dot bandana and rolling up the sleeves of her blue overalls with the printed message, \"We Can Do It!\" The poster was a rallying cry, and has become a symbol for the women who took \"men's\" jobs working in shipyards, munitions plants and aircraft factories across the country.\nThe women, many of them housewives and mothers, proved they could do it. There should never have been any doubt, but before 1942, there was. Gould and her co-workers proved them wrong. They not only helped the U.S. turn back military aggression that threatened the world; they paved the way for generations of women.\nIn 2000, a historical park was created in Richmond, the site of four Kaiser shipyards, to honor Rosies and other homefront defense workers during World War II.\nBiden's invitation is further recognition of that vital military and social contribution Gould and her co-workers made to our nation, its defense and prosperity.\nThe invitation and recognition is a fitting tribute to their hard work and extraordinary service.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: World War II defense worker Phyllis Gould, 92, of Fairfax, volunteers as a docent at the Rosie the Riveter Visitors Center in Richmond, Calif., on Friday, Nov. 1, 2013.

But for 90 minutes last Tuesday, the former special education teacher wasn't defined by her medical condition.\n\"I was a dancer instead of a person with Parkinson's,\" says Byrnes, 62, of Santa Venetia who attended her first dance class for people who have the slow, progressive degenerative neurological disease. \"They treated me with dignity.\"\nByrnes' experience isn't the main focus of the Parkinson's Dance Project, the free drop-in class, offered every first, third and fifth Tuesday by Marin Dance Theatre in San Rafael. The class is structured to get those with Parkinson's moving   essential to help improve balance and flexibility, strengthen muscles and boost coordination. But there is no denying that the classes bring a certain amount of levity and connection to those with the disease, as well as their caregivers, who often feel isolated. \n\"I see a fantastic sense of community and a safe space for them to extend themselves and take risk with movement. I see a lot of joy and enthusiasm and smiles,\" says Torri Campbell, a clinical psychologist and former professional dancer who helped start the program three years ago and co-teaches with Brigid Hoag, a dance teacher with MDT.\n\"People who are diagnosed with Parkinson's often end up focusing on their symptoms, their disease, their medical appointments, and we really want to create a place where they can come and be dancers,\" she says.\nLast week, a group of about 20   students, spouses and caregivers   gathered in the auditorium at St. Vincent's, some like Byrnes for the first time. Classes begin with gentle, warm-up exercises and stretches while sitting that everyone can do, no matter how far along their disease is and whether they're in a wheelchair or not. Campbell talks them through movements   \"Try to find the freedom in your spine.\" \"Be careful and slow.\"   while Rob Ellis plays soft tunes on the piano.\nAbout 40 minutes into the class, Ellis picks up the pace on the piano and almost everyone is standing and dancing. Close to the end of the class, Campbell and Hoag stop giving directions and let the students free dance or dance in pairs.\n\"Sometimes spouses dance together. They never get an opportunity to do that, so there's a lot of joy around that,\" says Campbell, who lives in San Rafael and also teaches movement to seniors at the Redwoods in Mill Valley and family dance at Luna Dance Institute in Marin City.\nA few years ago, she attended a talk by Mark Morris, creator of the Mark Morris Dance Group, in which he mentioned the Dance for Parkinson's Disease program his group founded in 2001. She immediately flew to Brooklyn, N.Y., where the modern dance company is based, to be trained. She convinced MDT artistic director Margaret Swarthout that the program would be a good fit for the 18-year-old dance school.\n\"It's been really special,\" Swarthout says. \"It's been such a wonderful thing for us to do and to be able to use our medium of dance. It's an opportunity for us to give back.\"\nDon Errante, 78, a retired pediatrician who lives in Larkspur, has been going to the classes since the beginning. His wife of 29 years, Lois, began joining him two years ago when he could no longer drive himself.\n\"A lot of people with Parkinson's, motivation is a big problem, and they're not motivated to do these things unless they're in a group,\" Lois Errante, 75, says.\nThe class helps her as much as it benefits her husband, one of the nearly 1 million Americans with the disease.\n\"I've gotten to meet more people, people who are fun to be with, and see how they're doing. It's a tough disease,\" she says.\n\"I'm just in awe of what the dancers in this class come up with,\" says Hoag of San Rafael. \"We offer them a different way of expressing themselves.

Go to the State Comptroller's Office website atwww.sco.ca.gov and look for your lost property yourself. At this site you will find other links to websites that may have other lost sums, including the IRS or other abandoned property administrators in the remaining 49 states.\nMore information is available through the Marin County district attorney's consumer protection unit at 473-6495 or through its website atwww.co.marin.ca.us/da .\n  Marin County District Attorney", "author": "Marin Independent Journal", "title": "Consumer Tip: Don't pay finder's fees to claim your property"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Redwood High wrestlers Nathan Morris and Kenneth Berreman are perfect examples of kids taking full advantage of their high school experiences.\nThe senior duo leads the Giants and have them in the hunt as an MCAL dark horse.\nMorris is the wrestling purist who will be taking his talents to Stanford University in the fall.\nWrestling runs through the Morris family from his father and coach at Redwood Alan, to his older brother Dylan who is a Redwood alum and already wrestling at Stanford. \n\"I've been training with clubs at Stanford since my freshman year,\" Morris said. \"They were always asking me what my plans were for after high school, what my grades were like, and if I wanted to wrestle in college.\"\nIt seemed from the beginning that Morris was destined to wrestle at Stanford and once again be on a team with his brother.\n\"It's going to be awesome,\" Morris said. \"Especially considering that I've always been wrestling with my brother.\"\nMorris made it all the way through North Coast Section   placing third at 170 pounds   and to the state finals last year. He is looking to bounce back and go further this year.\n\"I'm really hoping to get that MCAL title,\" he said. \"Then I just want to keep working hard, do the best I can, be NCS champ and place at state.\"\nMorris credits his father for his success.\n\"He's not just constantly pushing me,\" Morris said. \"But what he does do is provide me every opportunity to get better.\"\nIt was his father who drove him to Stanford twice a week during the off-season for camps after all.\n\"Nathan has spent a lot of time in a car,\" coach Morris said. \"Wrestling is a sport where if you put in the work, you get better. Nathan has always put in the work and he's starting to see what comes of it.\"\nThen there's the fellow senior Berreman.\nBerreman is much more of a renaissance man.\nHe is very much a strong wrestler   he and Morris have even traveled to Okinawa, Japan together to attend wrestling clinics   but that's only part of who he is.\nBerreman also swims and plays water polo at Redwood while taking seven classes in his final semester, playing in the jazz band, and has recently turned in his paperwork to become a full fledged eagle scout.\n\"Music, scouting, sports and doing well in school are all really important to me,\" he said.\nOne thing is for sure, with a workload like that, he has certainly become a master of time management.\n\"It's kind of hard, but I've always found a way to make it work,\" he said. \"This year has been especially hard for me. Some seniors decide to take it easier but I personally decided to make it harder.\n\"There have definitely been times when my parents worry about me, worry I'm doing too much. I always find a way. I realize I could be a lot better at something if I were to drop everything else, but I just want to do it all.\"\nBerreman is a smart, thoughtful and kind young man which is exactly what his coach finds so fascinating.\n\"He's the kind of guy that always has a smile on his face,\" coach Morris said. \"He's pretty aggressive on the mat, which always makes me laugh because he's such a nice guy.\n\"But you know what, he gives it his all. He never asks any questions he just does whatever we need him to do.\"\nBerreman credits his fellow senior wrestler with driving him to become better on the mat.\n\"(Nathan) gives me something to work towards,\" said Berreman, who wrestles at 160s. \"He's someone who is a college-level wrestler, and you can definitely tell. He's much better than me and that's just huge motivation.\"\nMorris has definitely appreciated what Berreman brought to the team.\n\"When my brother graduated I thought I was going to be alone at higher level tournaments,\" he said. \"It's been nice to have Kenneth with me at all of them.\"\nThe bottom line is, both athletes conveyed that they have thoroughly enjoyed their high school experiences and that while ready for the next step, they will miss Redwood.\n\"(Redwood) has provided a really unique experience,\" Morris said. \"It's helped give me all the opportunities to get better.\"\nWhile Morris has dedicated himself to wrestling and Berreman has tasted many slices of life, both come together to lead the wrestling team. There's no wrong answer to which of them has made the most of their experience, there's only the fact that both are ready for MCALs, NCS and beyond.\nContact Brian Sanchez atbsanchez@marinij.com .\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Redwood High wrestlers Nathan Morris, left, and Kenneth Berreman work out in Larkspur, Calif. on Thursday, Jan. 9, 2014.

He scored inside and out, drilling a combined seven 3-pointers during that stretch and even rising up for a dunk at home against the Red-tailed Hawks. \n* What he said: \"We played a really strong preseason schedule and had a losing record coming into league. It was tough not winning a lot of games early but it definitely helps us down the line. I was shooting well from the 3s this week, trying to attack and get open and feed my teammates, too.

operating out of an office to close its doors.\nThe collective Caregiver Compassion Group, which closed Jan. 6, has been flying beneath the radar since moving into the office at 15 Woodland Ave. in 2011, after losing its lease in Sausalito. The San Rafael City Council adopted an ordinance in 1997 that states, \"A medical marijuana dispensary is not an allowable use within any district of the city.\"\nTwo Sonoma County residents, Berta Bollinger and Donald Hatt, are co-presidents of Caregiver Compassion Group, a not-for-profit organization and medical cannabis collective with about 300 mostly Marin members. \n\"We've been medical cannabis patients for a number of years,\" Bollinger said. \"We saw how it turned our lives around medically and have decided this is a viable and important thing that we are doing.\n\"We would like to continue doing it in the broad daylight instead of feeling like we're criminals,\" she said. \"It's 2014, for God's sake. The law has been in effect since 1996, and we still can't figure this out?\"\nThe law Bollinger is referring to is Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, which legalized the use of marijuana in California for medical purposes. The initiative passed with a 55 percent majority vote.\nSeveral Marin residents who were getting their cannabis via the Caregiver Compassion Group have written letters to the council asking it to lift its ban. San Rafael Mayor Gary Phillips could not be reached for comment.\nPeter of Eliaser of Novato wrote that he is a quadriplegic who uses medical marijuana to seek relief from spasms caused by his chronic, progressive multiple sclerosis. Eliaser wrote that \"the medical cannabis helps relieve the suffering. The city of San Rafael should allow for patients' bona fide use of medical cannabis, and consider rethinking their position in this matter.\"\nAnother Marin County resident, Mitch Stein, wrote, \"I used to require significant pain medication for my condition, but can now alleviate my pain with a few puffs of marijuana in vapor form or a few bites of a cookie obtained legally from the good people at CCG.\"\nStein did not provide any detail regarding his medical condition.\nSan Rafael police Lt. Dan Fink said following \"some community complaints,\" he assigned his plain-clothes street crimes team to check out Compassionate Caregiver's San Rafael office.\nBollinger said in October a plain-clothes officer came to the office and tried to join the collective using a medical cannabis card issued by a physician whose license had been revoked.\n\"We wouldn't let him in,\" Bollinger said. \"About 10 minutes later, he came back with a whole contingency of other officers.\"\nFink, however, denied trying to run a sting on the delivery service.\n\"We sent one person in plain clothes to ask about purchasing marijuana,\" Fink said. \"He didn't have a card. He simply asked, 'What's the procedure?'\"\nFink said the undercover officer was admitted to an antechamber, but the officer never gained entry to the main office so Fink doesn't know if there was any cannabis on the premises.\n\"I can tell you when we were there talking to them there was an extremely strong smell of marijuana outside the gates of their business,\" Fink said. \"I don't know if that is because they were smoking it in there or if they had product in there.\"\nFink said his undercover officer was told \"they would sell to him there with a card or they would also do delivery.\"\nBollinger said, \"No medicine was on-site here at the office. This was just to keep our computers going, punch in the sales, that kind of stuff. The medicine was coming from someplace else.\"\nBollinger said, however, that people would come to the office to sign up for the collective.\n\"We also did counseling here,\" she said. \"It was place for people to come for feedback, information and support, but not to get medicine.\"\nAt one time there were at least half a dozen medical marijuana collectives dispensing cannabis out of Marin County storefronts. Following a crackdown by federal prosecutors in 2011, however, only one remains: Marin Holistic Solutions in Corte Madera. Corte Madera officials have indicated they will not allow Marin Holistic Solutions to continue operations after its lease expires later this summer.\nIt would appear, however, that Compassionate Caregiver Group may be just one of many medical marijuana delivery services operating in Marin.\nThe websiteWeedmaps.com provides a list of seven from which to choose: Deta Delivery, Green Beauties, Garden Gateway, SVO Outreach, Remedies Xpress, Greenlight Alternatives and Goddess Deliveries.

We came on real strong and showed we're contenders. For us it all starts on the defensive end.

It is a lovely place we all enjoy, but often my daughters are filled with fear. We have witnessed individuals conducting drug transactions, defecating on the pathway where we walk, spreading of trash, and many other activities that take away our experience in this lovely place.\nI was shocked to find out the lack of concern the authorities actually had for our local open space and the safety of our neighborhoods.\nAt one point during a meeting I attended, a homeowner mentioned the high number of thefts from garages and yards as well as cars being broken into were directly related to the problem in the marsh. This was confirmed during a community clean-up day when trash recovered in one of the encampments was papers from a local nearby resident, bicycle parts, drug paraphernalia, trash and a wide array of other items.\nThanks to Corte Madera Public Works, much of the trash was hauled away, but the police failed to patrol or take the advice of local residents who frequent the area.\nNow it is time for the Central Marin Police Authority to take action by making the marsh safe for us all.\nIt has taken another fire, overtime paid to police and fire officials and the closure of the marsh for days to highlight a problem that was commonly known.\nWalter Weis, Corte Madera\nCalming traffic\nMarin could try to slow traffic down with speed bumps, humps, lumps, dips or rumble strips. These \"sleeping policemen\" are universally hated. Motorists thump over them, then aggressively accelerate, annoying neighbors. Bicyclists topple over from any surface irregularity. High-speed driving defines emergency responders who reflexively oppose them.\nSpeed tables are less jarring at neighborhood speeds. Long, sloped ramps buttress a center crosswalk for pedestrians. With sidewalk bumpouts to narrow crossing distance, elderly pedestrians have a fighting chance.\nThey are not inexpensive, but cheaper than roundabouts or lawsuits from crosswalk casualties. Speed tables ensure drivers will slow down, if not stop for pedestrians.\nFew drivers drive slowly outside their own neighborhood, because roads are designed for speeding. Psychological traffic calming approaches slow traffic by creating driver uncertainty through deconstructing conventional traffic engineering.\nEnforcement of speed limits by police patrol is prohibitively expensive, yet arbitrary, sporadic and basically ineffective.\nEngineering solutions are always on duty, but psychological traffic calming and education are more affordable and effective.\nOr safer speeds for every condition could be wirelessly enforced through engine computers from road signs.\nStephen Simac, Stinson Beach", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 14"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Most of Marin County's pharmacies reported Monday that they were temporarily out of influenza vaccine following several days of heavy demand.\n\"What we're seeing is that they're having trouble keeping up with the demand,\" said Dr. Matt Willis, Marin County's public health officer. \"There was a lot of interest in the vaccine over the last few days.\"\nLate last week, two deaths linked to influenza were reported in Marin, and deaths were also reported in Contra Costa, Santa Clara, Kern and Sacramento counties. On Monday, two more deaths were reported in Santa Clara, one in Sonoma and one in San Mateo counties. \nThe predominant influenza virus nationally and in Marin this season is influenza A H1N1, commonly known as swine flu. When the swine flu strain first emerged in 2009, it led to a global pandemic and resulted in the deaths of five Marin residents younger than 65. Influenza deaths are not reported in people aged 65 or older. It's been determined that at least seven of the Bay Area influenza victims this season died after contracting swine flu.\nIn 2009, swine flu distinguished itself from existing seasonal strains at the time by proving to be somewhat more serious in young adults who were otherwise healthy. Normally, influenza hits the very young and the elderly the hardest.\nOne of Marin's two fatalities this season was an otherwise healthy, 48-year-old woman. A flu victim in Sonoma County was 23 and had no apparent underlying health problems. During the 2009-10 flu season, it is estimated that swine flu caused the deaths of 284,000 people worldwide, including 657 Californians.\nAn informal survey by the Independent Journal on Monday morning found that only seven out of 27 Marin pharmacies had flu vaccine available. Four out of five of the Rite Aid pharmacies contacted said they had at least some vaccine left, as did the Target store in Novato, the Pharmaca Integrative Pharmacy in Mill Valley and Passport Health in San Rafael.\nNone of nine CVS, four Walgreens or four Safeway pharmacies reported vaccine available Monday morning, although the Safeway in Novato said it expected to get an additional supply later in the afternoon.\nAshley Flower, a spokeswoman for Rite Aid, said, \"It's just a very fluid situation. We're watching it closely. We're able to reallocate the vaccine from one area to another. So we're just keeping a close eye on that and adjusting as we need to.\"\nMike DeAngelis, a CVS spokesman, said, \"It is possible that individual locations may experience sporadic shortages of flu vaccine based on demand, and we make every effort to resupply any pharmacy or clinic that runs out of vaccine as quickly as possible.\"\nMost of the pharmacies contacted said they ran out of vaccine over the weekend, but a few said they ran out on Thursday and Friday. Many said they expected a new shipment on Tuesday. Some, however, said they weren't sure when they would receive more vaccine. One pharmacy said it expected its next allotment to be relatively small, no more than a few dozen doses.\nWillis said, \"The community is aware of the risks of not being vaccinated and are going to pharmacies and their medical providers in record numbers.\"\nWillis said one of the commercial pharmacies told him it saw a 1,200 percent increase in demand for the vaccine over the weekend, administering 800 vaccinations in a 24-hour period at its Marin County outlets. He said the business, which did not want to be identified, told him it ran out of vaccine Sunday afternoon and had nothing left on Monday.\n\"Some of the larger retail chains are out of vaccine today but are expecting more vaccine tomorrow,\" Willis said.\nJoe Fragola, a spokesman for Kaiser Permanente Northern California, said, \"Last week, we experienced some isolated shortages of vaccine, and moved available supplies between our facilities to meet demand.\"\nBut Fragola said, \"We aren't aware of any spot shortages in Marin.\"\nWillis said state officials have assured him that \"this is not a problem of net vaccine supply so much as an issue of trying to keep up with distribution to areas like ours where there is a lot of demand for vaccine over a short period of time.\"\nWillis said the county still has a supply of vaccine and is ensuring that Marin health clinics serving the disadvantaged have what they need.\n\"We just gave the Marin Community Clinics another 150 doses today,\" he said.\nThanks to the county of Marin, free vaccinations were administered to 70 people on Saturday at Whistlestop in San Rafael.\nContact Richard Halstead via e-mail atrhalstead@marinij.com", "author": "By Richard Halstead", "title": "Most Marin pharmacies out of flu vaccine, new shipments expected soon"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "EVERY WEEK for the past two years I have used the crosswalk to cross Fifth Avenue and D Street from San Rafael City Hall to the Police Annex on the south side of D Street.\nI make this journey several times a day. Most of the time I am wearing my uniform. I do not take it for granted that the sight of a uniformed police officer stepping off the curb to cross the street will have any effect on the actions of the drivers traveling on Fifth Avenue.\nIt often does not. \nDrivers are talking on their cellphones, texting, staring straight ahead (almost refusing to make eye contact) and lost in their own world. This intersection is often used by the trainers of Guide Dogs for the Blind.\nI cringe each time I see a volunteer and their dog step into the roadway.\nAs the leader of the San Rafael Police Department, it is my responsibility to protect everyone in San Rafael. The protection of life, and the safety of everyone in our community, is the central goal of any professional law enforcement officer; however, we cannot be everywhere all of the time.\nOur crime prevention efforts are mostly focused in areas where crime is most likely to occur.\nFor the past two years, we have deployed two motorcycle traffic officers, after having no traffic officers for a time.\nOur traffic officers alone are not enough to keep our streets safe. We need the assistance of everyone in our community to make this a safer environment for all.\nThe number of fatal auto/ pedestrian accidents in San Rafael in the past two-year period should cause all of us to pause and consider what we can do to make our community safer. We experienced no homicides in the past two years, yet five pedestrians were struck and killed by motor vehicles during that same time frame.\nPlease do not think I equate the unlawful killing of another human being with what is often cited as a traffic accident. However, the end result is the same: someone has lost their life. In addition, in the case of a fatal automobile versus pedestrian accident, the driver of the vehicle is left with significant scars.\nThe loved ones, friends and greater community associated with those struck and killed will never be the same. Their loved one has been taken away because of a terrible accident.\nAn accident is an event that is not planned or intended: an event that occurs by chance. Someone loses their life by chance?\nThat is not acceptable.\nI often see pedestrians step into a crosswalk radiating an attitude of \"I have the right of way, so all vehicles will surely stop for me.\" Although they are legally correct, that legal right of way will never prevail against 4,000 pounds of steel.\nBoth drivers and pedestrians bear full responsibility for their actions. We are seemingly always in a hurry. We are important. The rules don't apply to us. We are sure that if we don't make eye contact with the person in the crosswalk, then the next driver will surely slow and stop for them.\nWe are always in a hurry. We never seem to have time for the little courtesies.\nI would ask everyone who is in such a hurry to talk to one of my officers or chaplains after they have spent several hours with a driver who has just fatally struck a pedestrian. That driver will never be the same. That moment will stay forever in their memory. Their tears and regret will not bring the person back to life. It is final.\nIt only takes a few seconds to change one's life forever.\nAs we start the New Year, we must all do our part and recognize that we are all responsible for our actions and for the safety of our fellow citizens.\nNo text message, no meeting, and no distraction are as important as the life of a fellow human being.\nBe safe San Rafael.\nDiana Bishop is the police chief of San Rafael.

Jefferson was standing at a bus platform on the west side of the terminal when the gunman approached from Tamalpais Avenue and fired his gun, police said.\nJefferson, then 22 years old, staggered across the transit center and collapsed near a cement bench, where he was helped by an off-duty paramedic and a private security officer.\nThe gunman got into a gold sedan and was last seen racing down Second Street toward Highway 101. San Rafael investigators identified the suspect as Dean and tracked down the car, which contained ammunition that matched the shooting, according to the prosecution.\nDean was arrested about two months later after police received a tip that he was at a friend's home in New Orleans.\nThe prosecution has not specified a motive for the attack. Dean's defense attorney, Stephen Shaiken, does not dispute that Dean was at the transit center but said his mother, Kaiser Alexander, is a transient who lives nearby.\nShaiken also told jurors that witnesses have offered conflicting statements about the shooting, including which direction the attacker came from.\n\"There is great discrepancies as to everything,\" he said.\nThe trial resumes Wednesday before Judge Terrence Boren in Marin Superior Court.\nDean's criminal history includes charges for a home invasion robbery in Solano County and the robberies of pedestrians in Marin City.\nContact Gary Klien via email atgklien@marinij.com orhttps://twitter.com/GaryKlien\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Ladrakeous Sonny Dean, left, is wanted on suspicion of attempted murder for a shooting Friday at the San Rafael Transit Center, police said.

My daughter's closet, that is   the closet that was the source of so many ignored parental demands to clean up the mess, get rid of the junk and vacuum the floor. My now college-freshman daughter's closet was waist-deep in old clothes, toys, papers, shoes, costumes and dust.\nMy daughter is a slob, except now she is a slob in a college dorm some 3,000 miles away from Mom and her room-cleaning demands. The first free weekend after we had flown across the country to deliver her to school, I got my trash bags and set to work. The sorting plan was simple: a pile to keep, a pile to Goodwill and the rest to the dump. But, oh, the memories that came flooding back as I dug through the closet layers. \nThe backpacks   I start with her high school canvas bag, but then soon find her middle school black-with-cherries backpack that we had special ordered during her everything-cherries phase. Finally, I find her purple grade-school backpack, with the \"friends\" and rainbow patches neatly sewn on. Along with the backpacks, I found the fake-fur Indian medicine bag I had sewn for her, age 4 or 5, after we read a story about Sacagawea. I told her the bag was made from lynx fur and she carried it for a long time, filled with feathers, a real snakeskin and assorted rocks and shells.\nThe closet held so many old shoes, but it was the pretty white flats that brought back memories of shoe shopping on a hot summer day in Paris   and the sore feet and ice cream afterward.\nI found her Brownie Girl Scout vest, with its badges for friendship and sports, and thought of the generous mom who made time to be her troupe leader. And I found the small pink tent that my daughter set up in our living room for months at a time as her home away from home when she needed her own private place to read and sleep. There were so many costumes, and I carefully hung up the wizard robe with the long silver sleeves, made for Halloween at her specific request during her Harry Potter period, and the Little Red Riding Hood dress and cape.\nI threw away the old math homework, the lonely socks and the single Barbie shoes. But I carefully rolled up the growth chart, with the dates and heights carefully marked, each one representing a happy \"look how much you've grown\" moment of pride. And, so much more.\nI got to the bottom, swept up the debris and vacuumed the floor. I made neat piles and carefully placed the \"keep\" pile back in the closet, orderly now.\nWhen my daughter comes home for the holidays, she will not like the order. She may have to toss some clothes around, just for old time's sake. Just to make her mom remember where she's been.\nCarolyn M. Jones is a San Rafael resident.

Here's a list of goals that Marin town and county governments should pursue in 2014.\n1. Conduct an origin-and-destination study of residents in every Marin apartment complex with more than 25 units. Include a modality question to determine the means of travel, whether it's auto, transit, bicycle or walking, for all their trips.\nThe regional alphabet agencies' claims about environmental benefits of building high-density housing near transit routes are faith based. There are no North Bay studies to show what means of travel are actually used by residents of large-scale housing. \nHow much better to make those potentially community-changing decisions with actual facts? Any study must be conducted by a neutral data-compiler who lets the results speak for themselves.\n2. Provide public employee retiree health insurance only when employees reach 65 years of age.\nRetiree health care insurance costs are consuming an evermore-substantial portion of Marin municipal budgets. The bulk of those unsustainable costs are incurred between the time the employee retires from government service and when they reach age 65.\nFor police and fire personnel retirement can be as early as age 50.\nA good many of those now-retired employees go on to jobs in the private sector that also provide health insurance.\nIf 65 is the starting date, retirees can participate in Medicare, with a supplemental policy paid by the government for which they last worked as retirement benefit.\nFairness dictates this reform should apply only to new employees.\n3. Each city, fire district and the county should be required to prepare a wildland fire safety report card. The effort would determine which agencies and their residents are following best practices to make certain that they are protected from the greatest threat to life and property in Marin: wildland fire.\nThe results should not only include evacuation procedures after a wildland fire starts. It needs to disclose if communities are doing everything possible to assure that a small brush or house fire doesn't spin out of control, morphing into a community-destroying disaster.\nGrade these agencies on the curve so we learn which jurisdictions are outstanding and which need to shape up.\n4. Pursue functional consolidations of sewage districts. It's now politically impossible to rationally merge Marin's nine independent and two city-controlled sewage districts into one agency. The next best approach, locally pioneered by some school districts, is called functional consolidation.\nThat method retains independent sanitary districts with their elected boards but their professional staff is shared among all agencies. There's no reason that maintenance work and front-office functions can't all be performed by one central professionally managed staff.\nThe functional duplication that's now the norm is expensive. It inevitably results in an inconsistent level of service and repair.\nFunctional consolidation is fiscally and operationally efficient while retaining district-level control. The only excuse not to pursue this reform is that veteran elected sewage commissioners will cry \"we've never done it that way.\"\n5. Require restaurants and institutional food outlets to post a Marin County hygiene grade at each establishment's entrance. New York City mandated this reform years ago, complete with an A-to-F grading system. It's time allegedly progressive Marin followed suit.\nCurrently, Marin County's Environmental Health Services' hygiene reports for restaurants are posted online without any rating. Realistically, no one enters a caf\u00c8 and goes online to check sanitary reports.\nCounty supervisors need to buck Marin's 1,400 food purveyors, some of whom understandably prefer that their patrons don't see a negative cleanliness grade posted on their front door.\nColumnist Dick Spotswood of Mill Valley now shares his views on local politics twice weekly in the IJ.

This is the eighth report by the JNC and the first in more than 10 years.\nThe biggest change in JNC8 was the level of blood pressure that should be treated with medications in people older than 60. Blood pressure is always measured as the peak pressure (systolic) over the basal pressure (diastolic). Both the systolic and diastolic pressures are important, and both have thresholds for treatment. Previously the treatment threshold had been set at 140/90 and those with sustained blood pressure over that level would have been considered for treatment with medications. \nJNC 8, however, increased the threshold for starting therapy in otherwise healthy adults older than 60 to 150/90, 10 points higher on the systolic pressure than the previous recommendations. The new guideline also suggests that if medications are required, the goal for otherwise healthy, older adults is a systolic blood pressure under 150 rather than under 140.\nThese new recommendations do not apply if patients with high blood pressure also have diabetes or kidney disease. These people are considered higher risk, and the old standard of 140/90 is still the goal. The lower blood pressure goal also applies to younger patients (younger than 60) with high blood pressure.\nThe new JNC8 guideline is based on the findings from multiple medical studies that have questioned the benefit of aggressive blood pressure lowering in otherwise healthy adults older than 60. Even though high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure and death, no real benefit was seen in lowering systolic blood pressure to 140 rather than 150. On the other hand, keeping diastolic blood pressure under 90 has been shown to be of significant benefit for patients regardless of risk factors or age.\nPeople with diabetes or kidney disease are particularly susceptible to the effects of high blood pressure so it makes sense that the lower threshold of 140/90 stills applies to them.\nThis new guideline does not mean that if you are taking blood pressure medication and you are doing well with readings in 130/80 range that you should stop or cut back on your medication. Well-controlled patients should continue their medication unless directed otherwise by their doctor.\nBut for patients with newly diagnosed high blood pressure, it makes sense to wait a while and give lifestyle changes a chance. Cutting down on salt and alcohol, starting an exercise program and losing weight are all effective measures for lowering blood pressure. If the systolic blood pressure is hovering in the mid-140s, there is no urgency to start a medication right away. And for those with higher blood pressures that require medications, treating to get the upper number under 150 is sufficient (if you are 60 or older and don't have diabetes or chronic kidney disease).\nThere are other changes in the JNC8 guideline, including recommendations on which medications should be used as initial therapy.\nThe big change, however, is the treatment threshold. Raising the systolic threshold from 140 to 150 means that thousands if not hundreds of thousands of patients with borderline blood pressure may be able to avoid drug therapy. It is also important to realize that the blood pressure numbers are just that   numbers. They are part of an overall risk picture for any individual. In general, the lower the bloods pressure the better. Those who are blessed with naturally low blood pressure are at very low risk from cardiovascular disease.\nFor the rest of us, we should do everything we can to naturally lower our blood pressure with a healthy lifestyle that includes eating a healthy diet, daily activity, avoiding excess alcohol and salt, and reducing stress.\nDr. Bill Elliott is an internist at Kaiser Novato and an assistant clinical professor of medicine at UCSF.

Every property with a dedicated irrigation meter has an annual allocation of water. That allocation is then budgeted, at the owner's request, for use on a monthly basis throughout the year.\nA mandatory 50 percent reduction of that annual irrigation allocation should be implemented now to conserve water for domestic use, rather than waiting until April.\nWill there be landscape losses?\nFor sure.\nBut Marin also has some of the state's best landscape contractors, certified irrigation managers, and Qualified Water Efficiency Landscape-certificated managers and irrigation techs.\nOwners can, and should, seek out these professionals to implement their drought action plan strategies and minimize landscape loss.\nRichard Reasoner, Stinson Beach\nSupport local business\nI'd like to thank Novato council members for their support Tuesday night in considering and including the Novato Horse and Pet Supply store in the design guidelines of the North Redwood Boulevard Corridor.\nLaurie Lucchesi and her family are equally appreciative.\nWe all know commerce is vitally important to any city and recognizing one business at the expense of another is counterproductive.\nSo as the development of the Redwood Corridor moves forward, I hope that all the residents in Novato who depend and do business with Nero's firewood will continue to do so, and that Nero's receives the same consideration as Novato Horse and Pet Supply store for its location in the corridor, or elsewhere.\nTrish Boorstein, Novato\n'Another consultant'\nI was not surprised to read in yesterday's IJ that the Marin Board of Supervisors has hired another consultant for $37,000, this time \"to survey the work force, find out what people think about their jobs, colleagues and managers and fully assess performance in the organization, manager and employee domains.\"\nI suspect the supervisors may even have a consultant to advise them the best choice in the cafeteria for lunch every day.\nThe supervisors consistently use consultants to do the work that one expects the staff to complete.\nWhat did surprise me was a survey completed in 2012 found \"only about half of the 1,289 employees questioned reported having confidence in senior management's leadership.\"\nWe need better leadership from county supervisors and senior managers, and certainly the 2012 survey finding explains how such a massive failure like the $35 million (or more, given likely staff time and inefficiencies) computer system fiasco occurred.\nThis massive waste of tax dollars directly resulted from poor planning and judgment by senior staff and the Marin supervisors using very expensive consultants that sold them a system not suitable for Marin that has now been scrapped and is being replaced.\nNeed I mention they have hired yet another consultant to decide on a new computer system?\nIt is time to institute term limits and vote in new Marin supervisors that will properly represent their constituents in a fiscally responsible manner.\nBob Ratto, Novato", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 13"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "An East Bay resident who came to Marin City to sell about three pounds of marijuana Friday night told sheriff's deputies he was robbed at gunpoint of the marijuana. \nThe Marin County Sheriff's Office got a call from a resident on Terners Drive in Marin City at 7:23 p.m. saying a man was at his door asking for help, according to Marin County sheriff's Lt.

Rising to its crest requires hiking steep sections of fire road that provide a good workout and the reward is panoramic views. \nQueenstone Fire Road provides access to the east end of Big Rock Ridge Open Space. I prefer to do this hike as an out-and-back, so I can turn around any time and return via the same route. It's 1.6 miles up the Queenstone Fire Road to the crest of the ridge. The ascent is a steady uphill challenge as the fire road gains 1,200 feet in elevation.\nBegin the hike at the Open Space gate on Queenstone Drive in the Marinwood neighborhood of San Rafael. The uphill grade starts immediately and so do the views. To the east are the marshlands along San Pablo Bay near China Camp State Park. Las Gallinas Creek is the waterway along the Santa Venetia neighborhood and San Pedro Mountain is the forest-covered ridge towering above it.\nOak, madrone, manzanita and toyon trees line the road. Many of the madrone trees still have clusters of berries that normally ripen in December. Marin's lack of rain has withered some of the berries and that may impact wildlife that depend on the berries for winter food.\nThe eastern end of Big Rock Ridge is so narrow that the homes in Novato's Pacheco Valle are visible on one side of the fire road and houses in Marinwood can be seen on the other side.\nI'm accustomed to seeing layers of wispy white fog or thick clouds settle into low areas, but the recent blue-brown haze has tainted the scene a bit. Winter is usually a time of crisp clear air.\nLike everyone else, I hope rain will come in sufficient quantity to cleanse the air, quench the thirst of the dry landscape and fill our reservoirs. Until then, visitors to Big Rock Ridge will have to try and identify landscape features through the haze. Looking south, the distinctive line of eucalyptus trees on a long hill mark San Rafael Ridge and the prominent round grassy knob is Bald Hill standing above San Anselmo. Mount Tamalpais' profile is visible as a long sloping silhouette.\nAt the junction of the fire roads, veer left onto Big Rock Ridge Fire Road and walk as far as you wish. Return by retracing your steps back down the Queenstone Fire Road.\nTo reach Queenstone Fire Road, leave Highway 101 at the Marinwood exit and drive west on Miller Creek Road. Turn right on Queenstone Drive.\nTacy Dunham is the author of several trail guide books. For more information about her books, emailcottonwoodpress4ca@hotmail.com .

As fighting has escalated, some 14,000 Iraqis have sought refuge elsewhere, but Al-Kubaisi's parents, five sisters and 9-year-old brother have remained hunkered down in their home.\n\"The situation for my family has been very dangerous for two weeks now,\" he said through an interpreter from his bed in an Alameda County rehabilitation hospital, where he is being treated for bed sores and infections from lying on his back for as long as eight months at a time. \"My family is under siege and can't leave the house because it's so terrible outside. They have no groceries or things they need. There are air raids by the Iraqi military against militant targets, but at the same time a lot of innocent people have died. I worry about my family more now than ever.\" \nA good-looking young man with a ready smile and an unruly corona of dark, curly hair, Al-Kubaisi arrived in the Bay Area in July from Jordan under the sponsorship of the Hayward-based Alalusi Foundation, a nonprofit charitable organization that has helped resettle as many as 50 Iraqi refugees and their families.\n\"His personality and positive attitude helps him stay alive,\" said Hesham Alalusi, the foundation's president and founder. \"Psychologically, somebody else would be in despair and wither away. But this guy is alive and open and looking forward. He's always looking forward.\"\nAl-Kubaisi doesn't yet speak English. But, through a translator, his harrowing story is being recorded by the Marin-based Citizens Reach Out as part of its \"What Happened?\" project, an archive of interviews documenting the accounts of Iraqi refugees displaced as a result of the 2003 U.S. invasion.\nOn Jan. 16, Citizens Reach Out is hosting a benefit for him at the Seahorse Restaurant in Sausalito. The money will help pay for a new wheelchair and a special bed that his supporters hope will allow him to live on his own.\n\"He gives us the opportunity to do something tangible, to actually help somebody,\" said Ruth Friend of Citizens Reach Out. \"And the second thing is that he gives us the opportunity, through him, to talk about what happened to millions of people. He's the vessel. He made it out somehow, and I don't understand how he did it. It must have been sheer will.\"\nAl-Kubaisi recounted what happened to him in heartbreaking detail in documents submitted to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the agency that referred him for urgent resettlement in the U.S.\nHe was a 16-year-old high school student on June 3, 2007, the day his life almost ended. He describes it as \"a normal day\" in Fallujah, a city that had been devastated by two of the bloodiest battles of the Iraq War. \"Normal,\" in this case, is relative. The day before, a friend of his was shot in the head and killed by an American sniper.\nBut he wasn't thinking that would happen to him when he ventured out of his family house in an alley near an American military base to walk to a neighborhood market.\n\"As I was heading across the street, all of a sudden I heard a shot,\" he remembered. \"I fell to the ground in the middle of the street, but did not lose consciousness. I saw that I was bleeding and felt a lot of pain.\"\nThe bullet, his doctors later determined, had been fired by an American sniper. It hit him in the back, blasted through his spine and exited his chest.\n\"People did not want to come into the street to help me at first because they were afraid that someone would shoot them as well,\" he told the UNHCR. \"An older man who lived nearby eventually carried a white flag out into the street and came over to help me. Four or five younger men followed him and helped carry me to a car.\"\nThey drove him to a local medical center for emergency treatment, trying to staunch his internal bleeding. He was then shuttled around to hospitals in Baghdad before being taken back to a hospital in Fallujah.\n\"The doctors thought I would die because my blood was so low,\" he said. At yet another hospital, an MRI confirmed that he was paralyzed from the chest down, able to move only his head and arms.\nAfter 28 days, he was sent home, but the heat at that time of year contributed to his wounds becoming infected. His family exhausted its financial resources taking him to Jordan for further treatment and physical therapy. After eight months, he and his family were forced to return to Iraq.\nOnce settled back in Fallujah, a friend pushed Al-Kubaisi in his wheelchair to an American military base, where he told an officer in charge what had happened to him.\n\"My family spent a lot of money on the medical help I needed, so I went to the military base to ask for compensation, or even to assist me to get out of Iraq to receive the appropriate medical treatment,\" he said from his hospital bed in San Leandro. \"In the early stages of my treatment, it would have helped a lot. But they didn't assist me in any way. They said we're sorry. We shot you by accident, and that was it. We can't compensate you for anything.\"\nThe IJ contacted Army Public Affairs for comment, but had not heard back by press time.\nBecause he had gone to the American base, suspicions arose in his neighborhood that he was supporting the U.S. cause. As a result, his family got the first of several death threats. One was a letter with a bullet in it, another was a DVD showing the slaughter of U.S. and Iraqi soldiers. It was signed by an Al-Qaida organization that had taken over their neighborhood.\n\"I was very depressed and the city was so violent that I was unable to do anything out of fear of being hurt,\" he said. In October 2011, he fled to Jordan, where he sought help from the UNHCR, the refugee organization that aided in resettling him in the Bay Area.\nOne of his interpreters, Farah Al-Mousawi, a 29-year-old Iraqi living in San Rafael, brought him the book \"English the American Way,\" to help him learn how to communicate in his new country. Under his bed is a ukulele from another new friend teaching him how to play it in exchange for lessons in Arabic.\n\"I had heard about the American people's friendliness and kindness, how they would reach out a hand to a person who needs help,\" he said with a smile. \"That's something I realized even before coming to America.\"\nUnderstandably, he harbors some resentment against the American military for what it did to him and his country.\n\"I was at the time of my life when I was enjoying normal teenage years with my friends and family,\" he said, \"and all that was taken away from me. \"\nBut he is not one to dwell too much on what he's lost, preferring to look at better days ahead.\n\"I'm hoping that I can continue on here in America with the goals I had before I was injured,\" he said, noting that he would like to study to become a pharmacist. More than anything else, though, he thinks about the family he left behind.\n\"It really pains me to be away from them, to be separated from them for this long,\" he said. \"I'm new in America, and I don't know the ropes, how to make it happen, but my wish is to be reunited with my family here in America, where it's safe, and not a war zone like in Iraq.\"\nContact Paul Liberatore via email atliberatore@marinij.com ; follow him on Twitter athttp://twitter.com/LibLarge .

It would phase in over five years beginning in the 2015-16 school year and could cost the state $1 billion annually when fully implemented   adding an estimated 350,000 children to public schools. \nProponents argue those costs would be offset by savings later on. They point to studies showing that preschool prepares children for school, resulting in fewer being held back to repeat a year, lowered numbers in costly special-education classes, and fewer students failing in school and ending up in prison.\nThe state already funds preschool for certain 4-year-olds   those just missing the cutoff date to start kindergarten because they have birthdays toward the end of the year. SB 837 would order school districts and charter schools to make that class, known as transitional kindergarten, available to all 4-year-olds.\n\"Expanding transitional kindergarten for all 4-year-olds is the unfinished business of last year's important school reform,\" which revamped the state's school funding formula, said Sen. Darrell Steinberg, the author of SB 837. He called it the Democrats' No. 1 priority this year.\nBut Marin education officials aren't clear on whether the bill intends to make preschool available to all 4-year-olds or simply enroll even younger children in transitional kindergarten. Each comes with its own set of standards and requirements.\nPeggy Dodge, early childhood education professor at College of Marin, said there are many problems with the transitional kindergarten model of education for 4-year-olds.\n\"We agree it's time for that investment in children's years before school, but feel the vehicle is so wrong,\" Dodge said. \"It's just another grade of elementary school.\"\nIn preschool, Dodge said there is one adult for every eight children. This would change to one adult for every 20 children under the transitional kindergarten model. In addition, it would require those teaching younger children to obtain multi-subject teaching credentials, allowing people who are used to teaching 5th grade to teach young children without any special training.\n\"If it becomes another grade of school, it rules out people who've been trained in early childhood education and are the current work force. There could be a huge job loss,\" Dodge said.\nAmy Reisch, executive director of First 5 Marin, agreed that it's unclear exactly what the teaching standards would be under SB 837.\n\"There is some discussion among people in the field about whether what we're really talking about is transitional kindergarten or preschool,\" Reisch said. \"I think most of the field is very excited about the emphasis on closing the achievement gap and providing more opportunity.\"\nFirst 5 Marin is an independent government agency that guides the use of Proposition 10 funds for children up to 5 years old in Marin. Reisch said the whole First 5 Marin commission has yet to discuss the proposal, which was announced last week, but that more funding for additional education would be great.\n\"Any infusion of resources into the early care and childhood education system in this state is desperately needed and much appreciated,\" Reisch said.\nMichael Watenpaugh, superintendent of San Rafael City Schools, said he's in favor of the idea, but hopes the proposal will include more funding for schools.\n\"I certainly believe we need to have children in school as soon as possible, particularly given the new Common Core Standards and lack of available preschool in Marin,\" Watenpaugh said. \"However, it does present a facilities challenge. We've grow significantly over the last six years and have little classroom space.\"\nIf the bill picks up support from influential teachers unions and education advocates like the state PTA and the school boards association, California would join only a handful of states   Georgia, Oklahoma and Florida   with universal preschool. The bill already has the support of state superintendent of schools Tom Torlakson. But it's far from certain that Gov. Jerry Brown, who proposed defunding transitional kindergarten in its first year, would sign it.\nEspecially since he has already called for spending $11 billion   or more than 10 percent of the total budget   to pay down $24.9 billion in remaining debts the state racked up during the previous decade. More than half of that money would be used to repay public schools, whose state aid payments were slashed by as much as 20 percent in recent years to balance the budget. In addition, the general fund budget includes $45.2 billion for K-12 schools, an increase of nearly $4 billion from the current fiscal year.\nSB 837, known as the Kindergarten Readiness Act, would phase in an expanded transitional kindergarten program, currently available to children who turned 5 from Oct. 2 to Dec. 2. The proposed bill, meanwhile, would make children whose birthdays fall from Sept. 2 to Feb. 1 in the 2015-16 school year eligible for transitional kindergarten.\nIn each of the following three years, the bill would expand the window of eligibility   based on children's birthdays   by two months.\nIn the final year of the phase-in, all children who turn 5 during the 2019-20 school year would be eligible to enroll in transitional kindergarten. Potentially, California could need 8,000 additional teachers and 12,000 classroom aides.\nThe bill estimates the cost per student at $6,000; the average state cost of for a K-12 student is $9,000.\nContact Marin Independent Journal reporter Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter atTwitter.com/hansenmegan .

When I'd come back for summers I'd work at the San Rafael Community Center as associate director of their sports camps. I've done extensive volunteer work at things like the Pebble Beach Pro-Am and Pac-10   as it was back then   women's basketball championships. I've always kept one foot in the door to help out at major events, and I've always wanted to be a part of putting on these really massive events that tens of thousands of people can enjoy.\"\nImbimbo will follow in the footsteps of the late John Cardinale who died in March of gastric cancer. Cardinale was senior director of media and community relations, along with the title of track vice president. Cardinale was an innovator in crafting clever media events and spearheaded the track's astounding growth in local charitable causes.\n\"We've raised over $4.5 million for Speedway Children's Charities for Sonoma County's youth-oriented organizations; incredible, incredible organizations that we give money to,\" Imbimbo said.\nBut it's not about just handing out checks and hoping for the best. Imbimbo and other trustees of SCC vet all applications for grants. And they follow up face to face.\n\"Each of us does at least one site visit to an organization that we either funded or didn't fund so we can learn more about the organization and what they do and where the money goes,\" she said.\nThis is perhaps the most tangible part of carrying on the Cardinale legacy.\n\"His integrity, his diligence, his abilities as a leader in getting everybody motivated; I'm so glad that we were able to work so extensively together since 2006 so I was able to mold myself after him,\" Imbimbo said.\nWhereas that side of her duties is very fulfilling, the other side is challenging. The Bay Area sports media is very stick-and-ball oriented, and getting the print, radio and TV media to give racing its proper weight can be difficult. So media event enticements have to be unique.\n\"We've done cooking demonstrations with Jeff Gordon. We've taken Tony Stewart to train an elephant at the zoo. We've taken three Daytona 500 winners on cable car tours around San Francisco,\" Imbimbo said. \"I'm very involved not only with the media outreach on those events but the planning from signage to location scouting.\"\nAnd through that she's come to know the sport's heroes.\n\"To work with people like Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, and Jimmie Johnson in different media events has been an incredible part of my job; to know that they are good people as well as incredible athletes,\" she said.\nLooking towards the track's future, progress comes from innovative ideas. Last year was the first running of the NASCAR Express, a dedicated train straight to the track from Sacramento and the Central Valley. But along with improvement through grand ideas, there's also refinement through small details.\n\"I attend 49er games as a fan, and I always come back to our marketing and fan experience meetings with, 'Okay, this is what I saw, this is what I liked, this is what I didn't,'\" Imbimbo said. \"It is so important for us to get into the mind of the everyday fan.\"\nThat analytical approach and her passion for sports make Imbimbo a great asset to the coming era of the raceway.\n\"There is no one I trust to oversee a project more than (Imbimbo),\" Brennan said. \"She is able to run with a project from start to finish   both seeing the larger end goal and the minute details to get there. Whether it's overseeing a successful food drive or setting up for a race weekend, she is able to put together a solid plan and see it through to the end. Jen is good at her job because she brings a true passion for people and an incredible work ethic to everything she does.\"\nBeing one of the premier racing facilities on the continent gives Sonoma Raceway something very vital: the power to help.\n\"I think that success for the raceway is not only about our bottom line but making a positive impact in our community, whether it's through our Speedway Children's Charities, food drives, blood drives, toy drives, or children's Christmas parties,\" Imbimbo said.\nRacing is about adrenaline, and Imbimbo has one goal in maximizing that: \"Make sure our fans come out here and have an amazing, unforgettable time.\"\nPit bits\n* Lap times at the Roar Before the 24 testing at Daytona again proved that Novato's Memo Gidley has a legitimate shot at the biggest win of his career. The Corvette Daytona Prototype he will share with Alex Gurney, Jon Fogarty, and Darren Law placed fourth overall over the three days of testing.\n* Kevin Buckler's TRG Aston Martin Racing squad will field a pair of Aston Martin V12 Vantage GT3's in the GT Daytona class. The Novato resident's cars ran mid-pack in a class of 28 cars in the 58-car field.\n* Corte Madera's Tom Dyer also drove a top-10 car at the test, the Pickett Racing P2 Nissan ORECA. He isn't likely to race in the Daytona 24 on Jan. 25-26, though. Dyer was right on the pace of the other three drivers, and hopes to parlay that performance into drives with this or other teams at that level later in the year.\n*\nAfter winning in class at last year's 24 Hours of Dubai, San Rafael's Vic Rice tasted the agony of defeat on Saturday. The Lotus Evora Rice shared with three other drivers only turned 23 laps, finishing second to last in the 77-car field.\nTodd Telford covers motor sports for the IJ.

If you do that, you won't need supplements. That's what I recommend,\" a longtime San Rafael pediatrician and author of \"The Marin County Diet\" told the audience at his book signing event Sunday afternoon.\nAn engaged and eclectic group of about 35 nutritionists, medical professionals and parents showed up at Book Passage in Corte Madera to hear Dr. Albert Goldberg, the former medical director and nutrition advisor of Head Start in Marin from 1967 to 1972, discuss his latest book. The doctor did add that those over 60 would be best advised to take multivitamins. \nAlso in the group was the Larkspur resident's 4-year-old granddaughter Allyson, exhibiting considerable vim and vigor as she scampered around the room. Since the book, subtitled \"Feed your children right from birth,\" is a guide to optimal diets for healthy children, it would appear that Goldberg's son Louis and daughter-in-law Xuejun are succeeding with the program.\nThe book is called \"The Marin County Diet\" because Marin \"is a very healthy place to live,\" the doctor said, adding, \"By 'diet,' I did not mean weight loss. It's a nutrition book, not a weight loss book.\"\nGoldberg, who began practicing in Marin in 1967 and retired three years ago, said some foods believed to be healthful are in fact the opposite.\n\"In the past few years, Marin school administrators decided to replace sodas loaded with fructose and sugar in the schools. And what did they replace it with? Fruit juice, including orange juice,\" Goldberg said, to groans from the audience.\n\"What's wrong with orange juice? You take all the sugar in an orange and leave out the pulp, and the sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream too quickly. The pulp slows down the absorption of sugar,\" Goldberg said. \"A lot of people are making recommendations without having an understanding of the chemistry of the body.\"\nThe doctor also discussed the glycemic index. This index is a numerical scale indicating how fast and how high a particular food can raise a person's blood sugar level.\n\"The glycemic index is explained in the book. Few people eat things like bananas and watermelon alone. They eat them in combination with other foods. This changes the speed of absorption, so the foods may not cause blood sugar to rise as fast as the index suggests,\" Goldberg said. \"The glycemic index may be an interesting guide, but on a practical level, it's not that helpful.\"\nThe lecture was studded with interesting factoids, including, \"Babies are born with a taste for sugar. Breast milk is loaded with sugar,\" the doctor said. This is healthy because the sugar in breast milk is not isolated, but comes with a combination of protein and fat, he said. Breast milk is also high in cholesterol, which babies need for brain growth, the doctor said.\nOn the other hand, \"the taste for salt is not innate. It develops around four months of age.\n\"When a child is sick, every mother wants to give them chicken soup. However, if you look on the can, there are thousands of milligrams of sodium in every can,\" said Goldberg, who recommended making chicken soup from scratch.\nGoldberg served for 47 years on the pediatric staff of Marin General Hospital, and was as an adjunct clinical professor at the UCSF School of Nursing.\n\"For me, what is helpful is knowing the science behind these things,\" said Veronica Valero, a mother from Novato who came to the event. \"The biggest challenge I have a single parent is having the time to prepare wholesome, tasty fare for my son.\"\nAshley Wallace of Rohnert Park, who is five months pregnant, came to the event with her mom, Lee Ann Baxter-Lowe of Novato.\n\"It was interesting,\" Wallace said. \"When I was growing up, people didn't know as much about nutrition.\n\"I definitely want to go with a natural diet,\" Wallace said. \"I do it for myself, and I want to do it for my child.\"\nContact Janis Mara via email atjmara@marinij.com .

Pruning and preparing plants for spring growth is an important part of winter gardening and pays dividends later.\nRoses can be a thorny contradiction, however. While they are simple, beautiful and perhaps as old as gardening itself, roses are also complicated, bred into many thousands of hybrids and cultivars. It all can be intimidating to a beginning gardener. \nThe history and classification of the genus Rosa is a bit messy and difficult to grasp, which is perhaps part of the intrigue that prompts some gardeners to become rosarians, join rose societies and devote valuable time and resources to their acquisition and cultivation.\nThe kind of rose, however, does make a difference in how it should be pruned. Rather than try to fathom the Rosa genetic tree, let's instead get down to the basics so that prickly bush in your yard can be efficiently pruned with some degree of confidence.\nFirst off, the gardener should be prepared with clean and sharp pruners, loppers and some good gloves. The modified epidermal cells that we erroneously call thorns are a real menace and the wounds they inflict have a tendency to become infected. A good pair of leather gloves, or even some longer gauntlet gloves, are reasonable protection from these dangerous prickles.\nSecondly, the concept of the grafted plant should be understood. There are many old garden and species roses that are \"on their own roots,\" but most modern roses are growing on a rootstock from a different plant. The bud or graft union, if present, needs to be identified and any canes arising from the rootstock eliminated. Not doing so will weaken the grafted variety and in time overtake it. The union is usually a callused swollen area just above the crown of the plant.\nBecause roses are so valued and complex, the plants often will have labels. So keep them if you have them. The type of rose can then be easily looked up and any special needs addressed. If a label is found, hallelujah! Clean or replace the label, and be sure it is attached to a strong cane to be kept.\nAs with any woody plant, the gardener will start pruning on \"the three Ds\": the dead, the diseased and the damaged. Just removing these, along with any suckers from the rootstock, will sometimes simplify a complicated bush or vine. The next things to prune are parts of the plant displaying any of the natural enemies of the rose, such as fungal pathogens such as rust, powdery mildew and black spot.\nThe goal of the rose pruning is to create a situation in which future growth will maximize sunlight penetration and airflow throughout the plant. With this goal in mind, remove any crossing branches and make clean, angled cuts \u00ba-inch above desired outwardly facing buds on remaining canes to create an airy and symmetrical shape.\nTiming and sanitation should also be kept in mind. Pruning should be timed for late winter season or early spring. Sometime in January is usually best. If pruned too early, a plant might respond with new growth only to have it damaged by a hard frost. All old leaves on the plant or the ground should be removed as they can harbor fungal organisms. Likewise, take care not to injure the canes and anvil-type pruners should not be used.\nWhile these procedures will get the job done, there are plenty of exceptions. For instance, an old garden roses (bred before 1867) that only bloom on old wood are best pruned just after bloom. These would include damasks, mosses, gallicas and albas. Also, some species roses and modern ground cover or carpet roses can be pruned with much less precision, simply shaping them to their desired form. Additionally, new roses should be allowed to establish their roots before a hard pruning and most climbers should be trained where desired and their laterals pruned back to two or three buds.\nIf you are interested in learning more about roses, visit the Marin Rose Society's website atwww.marinrose.org . Information on rose diseases and abiotic disorders can be found on the University of California Integrated Pest Management roses webpage at http://bit.ly/1bOYq6v.\nFor some great hands-on rose pruning experience and advice, join the Master Gardeners and master rosarian Lenore Ruckman for a demonstration and talk on Jan. 11 at the Falkirk Cultural Center in San Rafael.\nThe University of California Marin Master Gardeners are sponsored by UC Cooperative Extension.

Chino, 28, launched the project for the iPad, and iPhone and Android smartphones while working full time as director of sales operations for San Rafael-based technology company Qube Learning and completing his master's degree in business administration at Dominican University in San Rafael. He lives with his girlfriend in San Anselmo. \nQ: You grew up in Arcata, where your parents own three restaurants. Did you work in the restaurants?\nA: I was a busboy at Plaza Grill throughout high school.\nQ: Why develop a game around an excavator? Wouldn't a tank be more marketable?\nA: I definitely thought about that. At the same time, there are a whole lot of people in that space already. We know we're in a niche market, but there is just an insane amount of worldwide interest in construction stuff, particularly excavators.\nQ: You charge $1.99 for the game; how is it selling?\nA: We don't give out specific download numbers. But I can say that about 80 percent of mobile games, free and paid, will never see 10,000 downloads, and we achieved that on both Android and the Apple platform within the first five weeks.\nQ: Are you profitable?\nA: We passed the break-even point about a month ago.\nQ: Who wrote the code for the game?\nA: We designed everything and then the programming was done in Pakistan.\nQ: Was the game expensive to develop?\nA: What was expensive were the accelerometer controls. When we started the project, we didn't know if simulated digging would even be possible on mobile devices. Digging is so computationally heavy that a lot of the devices' processors can't handle it. There are other excavator games in the marketplace. Most of them do not have digging. So what is the point of even having an excavator?\nQ: I understand you got the idea for the game by operating an excavator that belongs to your girlfriend's grandfather.\nA: The first time I got to operate it, her grandpa, Fred, said, \"Here's how the controls work. I'll be back in 20 minutes.\" He left me to dig up a bunch of stumps. I think he was gone closer to 40 minutes, but it seemed like five minutes. It's pretty intense when you're trying to memorize all the controls and you're shaking and rocking a 25-ton machine. It's pretty scary.\nQ: Where do you go from here?\nA: I'd love to be making a lot more games. It's a really fun process. It's really labor intensive though, especially in the testing phase. When we're in testing mode, no one is sleeping at all. You'll take a nap between two and three in the morning, get a new iteration and just keep going.\nContact Richard Halstead via e-mail atrhalstead@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Mobile games developer Andrew Chino holds his smartphone as he poses for a portrait in Fairfax, Calif. on Saturday, Dec. 21, 2013.

And it wasn't a particularly festive crowd, milling around quietly in their oddly monochromatic attire. Winter certainly put its damper on fun.\n\"Hey Jeff, can you please get that guy in the brown hat a seat?\" asked the manager in passing, obviously busy with some other task. I often liken bartending to running a half marathon with someone barking orders at you the whole time. Being a restaurant manager is similar, except that in a bartender's case, more orders means more money and in a manager's case all it means is more gray hair. \nAt any rate, the manager was gone long before I had the chance to tell him that the man in the brown hat had already asked me the same thing. In fact he had also asked the other bartender the same thing, the bar-back, the cocktail waitress, the hostess, the other manager, the food runner and everyone else even remotely associated with the restaurant. In fact, he had even mentioned it to some of the other people waiting.\nI know, because each of them had repeated it to me. And I answered each of them the same way: \"All of the seats are taken. When someone gets up, I'll let him know.\"\n\"They are refusing to seat me,\" said the man in the brown hat to another man, dressed in black, who had actually been waiting longer.\n\"I don't know why they are doing this,\" Mr. Brown Hat told someone else, who neither asked nor cared.\nI call it playing the victim. Life sort of happens to some people. Everything they do is a reaction to some perceived slight. They are convinced that they are always being victimized; the girl at the coffee shop is ignoring them, the mechanic did something to their car, the mailman's losing their mail, the butcher gave them the small cut of meat, all on purpose. It's always something, and it's always being \"done\" to them. It must be exhausting going through life like that. I know it's exhausting from the other side.\n\"Sir, it should just be a minute.\"\n\"You sat that person first,\" he said, jabbing his finger at a person farther down the bar.\n\"You mean the pregnant lady?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"She was here before you, and even if she wasn't ...\" I said, letting the obvious dangle.\n\"They won't seat me,\" he said to a woman in a beautiful sequined black jacket.\nWhen a seat did become available, the man in the brown hat pushed his way directly into it. Thank goodness there were no small children or widows in the way.\n\"That's better,\" he said, sitting down.\nTrust me, it was not a sentiment everyone around him shared.\n\"Can I get something to drink?\" Mr. Brown Hat asked in that accusatory manner that often accompanies victim behavior.\n\"I don't know why they won't serve me,\" he tried to tell the seated gentleman in the black suit just as I was in the process of doing just such.\nDon't let the facts get in the way of your story, I always say.\n\"Nobody can truly believe how bad a day I've had,\" he said to anyone who would listen, which at this point was no one.\nIn the bar business, being at a customer's beck and call can have its drawbacks.\nMr. Brown Hat continued unabated by the subdued response of the small crowd.\nPeople playing the victim need an audience, but not necessarily an attentive audience.\n\"What's with all the black?\" he asked a young lady in an uncharacteristic moment of awareness.\n\"Some of us were at my younger brother's funeral,\" she said, gesturing at the room. \"He was killed in a car accident.\"\nMr. Brown Hat didn't know what to say.\nBut what was there to say? When one spends all his time playing the victim, encountering someone who has suffered real victimization can be uncomfortable, especially if the real victim isn't making a big deal out of it.\n\"Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears,\" wrote Marcus Aurelius in his \"Meditations.\" But then again Aurelius never worked in the bar business.\nJeff Burkhart is the author of \"Twenty Years Behind Bars: The Spirited Adventures of a Real Bartender.\" Follow him atwww.jeffburkhart.net and contact him atjeffb@thebarflyonline.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Jeff Burkhart mixes a drink in a shaker on Thursday, Sept. 6, 2012 in Novato, Calif.

But that's not just an interesting observation   it means we have less water in Marin's reservoirs than we would normally have this time of year.\nWe all need to conserve water by eliminating water waste. \nIt may be hard to believe, but just one year ago our reservoirs were 100 percent full, which was well above average. Today, they are below average and are continuing to drop.\nBecause we rely on our local watershed rainfall for 75 percent of our needs, low rainfall is indeed problematic.\nIn response to this situation, the board of directors of the Marin Municipal Water District recently passed a resolution encouraging water conservation among district customers. The board also directed district staff to take actions necessary to prepare for a dry year and instituted a Resiliency Task Force to address both short-term and long-term water supply issues.\nHopefully, we will receive rain this winter, but we can't operate under the assumption that we will.\nCalendar year 2013 was so dry that it set a new record low for rainfall on the Mount Tamalpais watershed, with less than 11 inches falling over the last 12 months. That's far less than the annual average of 52 inches and well below the previous record low of 19 inches set in 1929. We aren't used to such extreme reductions in rainfall   we've had abundant rainfall and water supplies for more than 20 years now.\nThat means many of us may have gotten complacent when it comes to conserving water. While water-efficient fixtures are the standard today, and you don't need to put a brick in your toilet tank, there are still actions you can take that will make a difference.\nHere are some ways to get started:\n* Turn it off: If you haven't turned off your irrigation system for the winter, now is the time. Even without rain, most plants require little water this time of year because they are dormant. During dry periods, check high-water-use plants for stress and water if needed. Don't forget a blanket of mulch to slow evaporation and protect roots from the cold.\n* Find and fix leaks: Our conservation specialists discover leaks in about one third of the homes they visit   and often the homeowners never suspected. Your water meter can help you monitor your water use and determine if you have a leak; find step-by-step instructions atmarinwater.org .\n* Get a rebate: To help our customers save water and money, MMWD is offering rebates for high-efficiency toilets, high-efficiency clothes washers and smart irrigation controllers. Learn more.\n* Call us. Need help finding ways to save water? We'll send a water conservation expert to your home or business for a free consultation. Call 945-1523 to schedule.\n* See water running down the street? Let us know by emailingconservation@marinwater.org or calling 945-1520.\nBeginning last spring, MMWD took steps to preserve our supply by making changes to our water system operations and enhancing our leak-detection efforts, and we continue to do the same. But we need your help and are asking you to do your part to conserve water.\nIf it rains in the next few months, we'll appreciate it all the more.\nAnd if it doesn't, we will be better prepared to live through a dry period.\nFire control will also be an important consideration in the spring and summer due to the dry winter. Depending on the storage levels on April 1, we may need to call for voluntary 10 percent water use cutbacks or 25 percent mandatory cutbacks.\nThe more water we all save now, the better off we will during the rest of this year and next.\nLarry Russell of Tiburon was the 2013 president of the Marin Municipal Water District Board of Directors and Armando Quintero of San Rafael is the 2014 president.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: A tire lies exposed on dried mud by Stafford Lake in Novato, Calif. on Thursday, Jan. 9, 2014.

This is one of the reasons that four local law firms are donating their time to \"save the farm.\"\nOn July 11, 2012, the state Fish and Game Commission, a state constitutional authority, sent a letter to then-Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar, which said: \"The commission, in the proper exercise of its jurisdiction, supports and continues to support the agricultural business of aquaculture, and to that end, has clearly authorized the shellfish cultivation in Drakes Estero through at least 2029 through the lease granted to Drakes Bay Oyster Company. The commission will continue to regulate and manage oyster cultivation of oysters in Drakes Estero pursuant to state law.\"\nThe letter also said the National Park Service should recognize the cultivation of oysters in Drakes Estero \"as a valuable resource to the public and to the economy of Point Reyes National Seashore.\"\nThe letter clearly details the state's jurisdiction.

Traffic was frequently mentioned. \nOver the past year, traffic jams have worsened, partly due to construction along the Novato Narrows   which when completed should help relieve congestion   and due to more commuters using the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge to return to their East Bay homes. Marin officials are working on reopening the long-closed third lane on the eastbound deck, but there's no promise it is going to occur quickly.\nEvery day, including weekends, we learn that all it takes is a fender-bender or a stalled car, and traffic can go from moving to mired.\nAt the same time, traffic is heavier off the freeway.\nMany Sausalito and Tamalpais Valley residents blame the new traffic signal at Tennessee Valley Road for tying up traffic, particularly on weekends.\nAnd the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit train, although making headway in construction and in acquiring funding, is still almost two years away from rolling, taking commuters from Santa Rosa to Larkspur Landing.\nMike Straus of Mill Valley summed up what a lot of Marin residents are saying: \"I feel like in the last year the traffic on Highway 101 has gotten worse.\"\nCertainly, decision-making over possible improvements didn't get any better. Marin officials worked for much of last year on a plan to improve traffic flow and safety in the Corte Madera-to-Greenbrae stretch of Highway 101. Even though they had money earmarked for the work, they couldn't agree on a plan, other than investing the money into a new multi-million-dollar bike path and helping SMART pay for extending its future service from San Rafael to Larkspur.\nHow either improvement is going to \"fix\" the freeway is debatable, but it certainly sent a message to local residents that consensus on improvements to Highway 101 are hard to come by. There's not much opportunity left for widening the freeway without disrupting existing homes and businesses.\nIf 2013 was any indication, there also is an absence of strong leadership and political consensus and trust on this front. Turning that around should be a goal for members of the Transportation Authority of Marin during 2014.\nSo should efforts to improve local transit. We need to make convenient and affordable alternatives to driving your car to and from work a top public priority. Lately, the trend has been raising prices and trimming service.\nBesides frustrating local residents and workers, traffic is Marin's No. 1 contribution to greenhouse gases. Getting traffic moving instead of worsening pollution-belching gridlock should be a countywide goal.\nThe problem is not going to get any better until community leaders build a long-range plan. That's going to require a strong foundation of trust, leadership and vision. The time for building that is today.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Brakelights come on as Highway 101 southbound traffic grinds to a halt during commute hours on Thursday morning, Nov. 14, 2013, in Novato, Calif.

But the DA now says there is not enough evidence to prosecute Mr. Grayson for assault with a deadly weapon.\nIt stands to reason that if Mr. Grayson did not threaten Deputy Kubota, that then the deputy should answer for firing bullets at Mr. Grayson. I called the DA about his failure to prosecute Kubota, and his chief deputy e-mailed me back \"that no charges were filed against the deputy due to insufficient evidence to prove a criminal violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\nOne would have thought that multiple bullets fired at an unarmed, non-threatening man was sufficient.\nIf Mr. Grayson cannot be prosecuted for threatening a deputy, what justice is there in the deputy not being held accountable for shooting at Mr. Grayson? Had Mr. Grayson been white, would the DA's findings have been different?\nThe deputy's shooting of Grayson and more especially the DA's decisions have outraged many in the African American community and those of us who are white.\nThis has set back all the efforts that Supervisor Kate Sears has been making to repair the hostility between the sheriff's substation and local people.\nThat hostility has been generated by years of discriminatory surveillance and humiliation that have provoked numerous community meetings.\nWhat's to be done? The state Government Code places the responsibility squarely on the Board of Supervisors as representatives of local citizens to supervise the conduct of all county officials, whether they are elected or not.\nThe supervisors also can further call on the DA to allow a jury or grand jury determine whether there is evidence to convict the county deputy of wrongdoing.\nAnd finally, this crisis cries out for the supervisors to form a citizens review and advisory council for the sheriff's department. Even before the DA's decision, nine Marin organizations, including the Marin City Community Services District Board, the county Human Rights Commission and groups representing Marin's Latinos urged the supervisors to create such a council.\nA third of California's counties have such boards that hear citizens' complaints and advice regarding their sheriff's departments and utilize attorneys, often volunteers from the local bar association, to assist them.\nAn independent citizens council is absolutely essential for rebuilding trust between Marin's citizens and the sheriff's department and supervisors.\nAlan Barnett of Mill Valley is a retired university professor and a longtime local activist for civil rights and peace.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Alan Barnett", "author": "By Alan Barnett Guest op-ed column", "title": "Marin Voice: Public deserves facts in Marin City shooting case"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "The question to ask at the World Guitar Show in San Rafael this weekend is not what's new, but what's old?

There's very few places you can do that.\"\nCommanding the highest prices are electric guitars built in the 1950s and '60s. On Saturday, one of the rarest and most expensive was a 1957 Fender Stratocaster with a price tag of $48,500. It was being sold by Oakland-based dealer Jay Rosen, who has about 50 used guitars for sale this weekend.\n\"It's an iconic guitar,\" he said as onlookers admired the sculpted shape of the nearly 60-year-old Strat. \"And it's pretty rare.\"\nBut he had another guitar even older and more rare if not more expensive. He opened a musty case and pulled out a 1950 Fender Broadcaster, the precursor of the popular Fender Telecaster.\n\"It was the first electric guitar the public could buy,\" he explained. \"They only made about 200 of them before they changed the name.\"\nIt wasn't in quite as good a shape as the Stratocaster, or as sought after, so he only wanted $39,000 for it.\nNovato's Dennis Haggerty has been a regular patron of the show, which began in Marin in 1998. But this is the first year he's been an exhibitor, sharing a booth with Novato neighbor Phil Rountree. The coolest item they had for sale wasn't a guitar, but a funky old sweatshirt with a picture of the early Beatles on the front, misspelled as the Beetles.\n\"Spelled correctly, those sweatshirts are $1,000 on eBay,\" Rountree said. \"Spelled incorrectly, they are even rarer.\"\nNevertheless, he would part with it for $1,000. Or less.\n\"I'll go down from there,\" he said.\nNot everyone went to the show looking to buy.

But we battled hard. I have nothing but praise for the girls.\"\nMC, which has lost five of its last six games, has struggled to find any consistency on offense. After her fast start, Langan was held to two free throws the rest of the game. Hannah Politzer, who had a game-high 11 rebounds, scored seven points after drawing a blank in the first half.\nPart of the Wildcats' offensive woes stem from the loss of starting guard Claire Renk, who will miss the entire season after undergoing knee surgery from an injury suffered playing club soccer in September.\nThe Wildcats, however, proved they can still play defense. They held the Braves to four points in the third quarter. Unfortunately for the Wildcats, all their hard work at the defensive end paid no dividends. They scored their first and only points of the third quarter after five minutes of futility on a pair of free throws by Politzer.\n\"We played a pretty tough third quarter,\" DeMartini said. \"We had a lot of good looks on shots that we didn't finish. If we make half of those layups we missed in the third quarter, maybe we make a game of it.\"\nJustin-Siena's Haley Cremen, who came in averaging 19.2 points per game, took it upon herself to snap the Braves' scoring drought and scored nine of her game-high 19 points in the final eight minutes.\n\"We got a little passive after halftime,\" Justin-Siena coach Mike Boles said. \"I thought our defense kept us in the game in third quarter. And then Haley got hot at the end. I think she's the best player in the league, but I'm biased.\"\nAlexis Tye scored six points for the Wildcats and teammate Scout Polizzotti added five points and nine rebounds.\nContact Tim Menicutch via email atsports@marinij.com\nJUSTIN-SIENA 48, MARIN CATHOLIC 29\nMCAL\nJustin-Siena           14           16           4           14                       48\nMC           7           10           2           10                       29\nJustin-Siena  Malloy 4 0-0 11, Moore 2 3-4 8, Irvine 1 1-2 3, Cremen 6 5-9 19, Mallari 1 1-1 3, Castellucci 1 0-0 2, Slinsen 1 0-0 2.

Of course, many of us don't put down our books even when December gets hectic. But January's a good time to rediscover what we loved about books in the first place. This month brings new novels by Tiburon's Tiffany Baker and Bay Area authors Maria Hummel and Kirstin Chen. Also on the list: a new memoir by \"L'Affaire\" author Diane Johnson and a nonfiction work on the importance of reading by Berkeley critic Wendy Lesser.\n* \n\"Mercy Snow\" by Tiffany Baker (336 pages, Grand Central Publishing, $25) Tiburon author Tiffany Baker (\"The Gilly Salt Sisters\") returns with this tale of two New England families. It's the mid-1990s in Titan Falls, N.H., and 19-year-old Mercy Snow has inherited her family's rundown home. Returning to town with her older brother, Zeke, and her younger sister, Hannah, she arrives with good intentions   until a terrible accident sends a school bus skidding off an icy road, killing one of the town's children. Zeke is blamed, and Mercy's quest to clear her brother's name forces her to take on the wealthy McAllisters, the town's ruling family and owners of the local paper mill. As the families' secrets come pouring out, Baker deftly balances personal grievances with broader concerns about pollution, economic justice and corporate responsibility in small-town America. She'll read from the book Jan. 17 at Book Passage in Corte Madera.\n*\n\"Motherland\" by Maria Hummel (384 pages, Counterpoint, $26) Family history fuels \"Motherland.\" Maria Hummel's novel, set in Germany during the waning years of World War II, is a moving story of love and privation, sacrifice and survival. The book's central character is Liesl Kappus, a young wife left to care for three stepsons when her doctor husband, Frank, is drafted as a medical military officer. Liesl's struggles to find food for the children are compounded when two refugee families move in with them; Frank, meanwhile, faces daily horrors in his work as a reconstructive surgeon. Hummel, a Jones Lecturer at Stanford University, delivers an intimate portrait of family life during wartime, one that draws on accounts from her father's German childhood and letters from her paternal grandparents discovered years after the war ended. She'll read from the novel at a book launch party on Jan. 14 at Booksmith in San Francisco.\n*\n\"Soy Sauce for Beginners\" by Kirstin Chen (256 pages, Amazon Publishing/New Harvest, $23) Bay Area author Kirstin Chen explores the East-West divide in this debut novel about a young woman's struggle to reconcile personal goals and family traditions. Her protagonist, Gretchen, is married and living in San Francisco when she discovers that her husband has been unfaithful. Gretchen impulsively packs up and moves back to her native Singapore, only to discover that all is not well in her childhood home; her mother is ill, and her father's soy sauce business is failing. If Gretchen's attempts to rescue the company and revive her love life feel a little predictable, Chen, who was born and raised in Singapore, navigates the culture with the insight of an insider.\n*\n\"Flyover Lives\" by Diane Johnson (264 pages, Viking, $26.95) Diane Johnson has scored hits with her keen observations in three novels, \"L'Affaire,\" \"Le Mariage\" and \"Le Divorce.\" In \"Flyover Lives,\" she turns to the memoir form, considering what it means to be American. It all starts when a French friend drops an offhand remark: \"It's funny,\" she says, \"the way all Americans believe they are descended from royalty.\" That's enough to get Johnson reflecting on her Midwestern roots. She digs into family history, tracking it back to the early American settlers and their pioneering westward journeys, spicing the narrative with a personal account of her own path as a writer. Meet the author Jan. 30 at Mrs. Dalloway's in Berkeley.\n*\n\"Why I Read: The Serious Pleasure of Books\" by Wendy Lesser (240 pages, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $25) Wendy Lesser, founder and editor of Threepenny Review, writes of the delights and rewards of reading in this new book of critical essays, sharing insights about favorite authors and the novels, plays and poetry that have changed her life. \"Reading literature,\" she writes, \"is a way of reaching back to something bigger and older and different. It can give you the feeling that you belong to the past as well as the present, and it can help you realize that your present will someday be someone else's past.\"\n -\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: 'Mercy Snow' by Tiburon author Tiffany Baker handout\nTiburon author Tiffany Baker's new book is 'Mercy Snow.'

In Marin, Mill Valley was one of the communities that embraced the emerging counterculture. Or at least some people did.\nResident rock musicians played in downtown bars at night, thrilling some and annoying others, who complained to the city about noise from amplified music. Young people swam nude in Cascade Dam, raising conservative eyebrows. And everyone was talking about the crazy stuff that was going on at Old Mill School, including students bringing large cardboard refrigerator boxes into the classroom to use as \"study hotels.\"\n\"Oh, those were great times at Old Mill School,\" a smiling Jim Derich, a former open classroom teacher, recalls in a fascinating new documentary by three 17-year-old Tamalpais High School seniors, Hana Dahl, Max Bayer and Paula Venables. \"People from all over wanted to see what the hell was going on here, what was so special.\" \nThe student team created the 12-minute film, titled \"Ol' Mill,\" as an assignment in Tam's Academy of Integrated Humanities and New Media (AIM), a two-year, three-subject program for juniors and seniors that blends required social studies and English courses with hands-on experience in digital video and audio production, web design and other media applications.\nThe filmmakers came to realize that AIM is the kind of progressive educational program that may not have been part of the Tam curriculum had the groundwork not been laid by the crusading teachers who bucked traditional classroom teaching methods at elementary schools like Old Mill.\n\"What is interesting to us is the program we're in, AIM, runs on a similar set of ideas as those of that era,\" said Venables, who plans on going to college to become a teacher. \"You can see how it paved the way for what we do today in AIM. They turn us loose with cameras for six weeks and say, 'Go find a story.'\"\nThe story they found came through Hana Dahl's cello teacher, a longtime resident who was among those in town who were not fans of Old Mill's \"cardboard box era.\"\n\"She was definitely against it,\" Dahl recalled. \"She thought it was a crazy thing that happened.\" She wasn't alone. The documentary points out that one family was so upset they moved to Switzerland.\nIn those revolutionary years, Old Mill was one of the Marin schools leading the way in student-centered alternative education, literally breaking down walls in experimental \"open classrooms.\"\nDeparting from conventional schoolrooms with desks lined up in rows, these were large spaces with teams of teachers overseeing students of different grade levels, ages and abilities. Kids sat on the floor or lounged on couches, played chess, read comic books and were encouraged to learn at their own pace. Homework was optional.\nIt was the cardboard boxes, three-sided affairs decorated by the students to reflect their personalities and interests, that really fueled critics' sense of outrage, thinking they were beyond kooky. From the teachers' perspective, they were intended to promote self-discipline, focus and creativity, giving kids their own private refuge. One boy drew redwood trees inside his.\n\"The husband of one of the parents we interviewed said it would be fine if you're going to live your life in Mill Valley, but if you're not you might want to go to a normal school with a real class,\" Bayer said.\nThe student filmmakers thought the cardboard box thing was pretty laughable themselves until they interviewed Lynda Chittenden, the now retired teacher who spearheaded the open classroom concept at Old Mill.\nIn the film, she describes the changes she and her colleagues instituted as \"visionary,\" recalling how teachers like her believed they could change the world.\n\"She swung us back the other way,\" Venables said. \"We thought, oh my God, this is a real thing. They were serious about trying to make reforms in education.\"\nIn addition to the two teachers, the filmmakers found and interviewed three parents, two former students and one woman who was highly critical of the experiment.\nFor the Tam teens, those interviews were eye-opening in other ways as well, painting a picture of a Mill Valley that was much more down to earth than the wealthy, upscale community they grew up in.\n\"It wasn't such an elitist community then, such a bubble,\" Dahl said. \"The town used to be more middle-class, with regular normal people.\"\nIt was also a haven for writers, artists, musicians, free thinkers and later wealthy hipsters whose hedonistic new age lifestyles were satirized by author Cyra McFadden in the \"The Serial,\" a series in the weekly Pacific Sun that became a book and a movie.\n\"We heard over and over in our interviews that Mill Valley was crawling with hippies, that it was free and easy,\" Venables said.\nShe and her fellow filmmakers may have been most shocked by how independent kids were then. They heard from one of the former open classroom students that there was no such thing as today's \"helicopter parents,\" so-called because they hover over their children, putting pressure on them to succeed.\n\"It was this little paradise where kids went outside and played until it was time to come home for dinner,\" Venables said. \"Parents didn't set up play dates for their kids. I had never heard of that before. How else would I go on a play date? My parents had to set it up for me.\"\nThe filmmakers may have laughed at first about kids in boxes, but it made them think about another kind of box that some high-achieving students find themselves in today.\n\"There's a box-checking mentality among kids in wealthier communities like this,\" Dahl said. \"If you do this and this and this and check all those boxes, then I can get into the best college and be a success. Our joke during this whole thing is that they might have physically put kids in boxes then, but now we put them in boxes metaphorically.\"\nFor a time, conservative forces in Mill Valley pushed back against the changes they felt threatened their peaceful little village in that turbulent era. Cascade Dam was closed in 1972 and later drained, putting an end to skinny-dipping. It seems unbelievable now, with rock bands playing every night at Sweetwater Music Hall and live entertainment flourishing at the 142 Throckmorton Theater, but the City Council actually banned amplified music for a time in the mid '70s.\nAt Old Mill School, the refrigerator boxes lasted only about a year, the students discovered, but many of the open classroom innovations continued on and have been integrated into the mainstream.\n\"As the '60s petered out, these radical educational ideas petered out, too,\" Bayer said. \"But in another sense they still kind of stick around today. You have these specific classes with project modes like AIM and you have AP (Advanced Placement) calculus with desks in a row where you study math. You have a combination of the two rather than one or the other.\"\nContact Paul Liberatore via email atliberatore@marinij.com ; follow him on Twitter athttp://twitter.com/LibLarge .

Novato's Paint the Town Red gala   celebrating the city's 54th birthday   is set for Jan. 24. \nNovato has long celebrated its birthday, but the red-themed gala began about 11 years ago. Around 200 people are expected this year, according to Jennifer Goldfinger, one of the co-chairs of the event. The party is a community partnership between the Citizen of the Year Committee, city of Novato, Novato Chamber of Commerce and School Fuel.\nNovato seniors last week got a taste of things to come as Goldfinger, event co-chair Victoria Crawley and Novato City Councilwoman Jeanne MacLeamy served them white sheet cake with red pastry rosebuds and carrot cake.\n\"You are the heart and soul of Novato, so we wanted to help you help us celebrate Novato's 54th birthday,\" Councilwoman Jeanne MacLeamy told about 40 members of the Senior Citizens Club gathered at the center for lunch.\n\"Since many members of the club won't be able to come to the party, we bring them cake beforehand,\" MacLeamy said afterward. The pre-event is a longstanding tradition for Paint the Town Red.\nSenior Nozer Patel, 74, attacked his cake with alacrity. In addition to the white sheet cake with whipped cream frosting, MacLeamy, Goldfinger and Crawley also handed out slices of carrot cake, which Patel pronounced his favorite.\nAlso featured on gala night is the announcement of Novato's citizen of the year. Last year's winner was longtime Novato volunteer Patty Bennett, whose late husband Chuck won the award in 2001.\nPaint the Town Red will run from 6:30 to 10 p.m. at the Margaret Todd Senior Center, 1560 Hill Road.

Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco were able to get the agency to extend the date to Feb. 18. \n\"There were some of the dog groups that requested an extension,\" said Howard Levitt, park spokesman. \"We have gotten several comments and expect more as we get closer to the new deadline.\nDog supporter Martha Walters of San Rafael said the extension is important to address issue in detail.\n\"I want good science, give me a good, thorough process,\" she said. \"There are 22 areas and only seven allow dogs off leash? It's a set up for failure. They want to take recreation out of the parks. First its dogs, then the horses, then windsurfers and it will go on from there.\"\nThe controversial issue has pitted passionate dog owners against park officials and environmentalists. Dog owners say their dogs need space to run and have started a websitewww.marincountydog.org to support their cause.\nBut there have been complaints lodged with recreation area officials about aggressive dogs attacking people and smaller animals scaring children and trampling on sensitive wildlife habitat.\n\"We are still opposed to dogs running off-leash and disturbing sensitive habit,\" said Barbara Salzman, president of Marin Audubon. \"There are places for dogs to run off leash, like dog parks. Many cities have them.\"\nDuring a comment period on the initial 2011 dog leash document, the park received more than 4,700 comments, a majority from dog lovers who disagreed with it. Because of the comments, and additional data and studies, the supplemental draft was developed.\nIn the \"preferred alternative\" of the older plan, off-leash opportunities were greatly curtailed   and in some cases were banned altogether   on federally managed beaches and trails in Marin, San Francisco and San Mateo counties.\nOne of the changes for Golden Gate National Recreation Area lands in Marin under the new plan is at Muir Beach. Dogs are now allowed off-leash under voice control at the beach. The 2011 plan called for an outright ban, except for the parking lot. The latest plan allows dogs at the beach, but on a leash.\nBut for Muir Beach resident Pam Swarts, that is not an ideal solution.\n\"Dogs need a place to run. Dogs are more sociable and less aggressive off-leash,\" said Swarts, who walks her dogs along the beach. \"The environmentalists and bird lovers are crying foul, but there are miles and miles of open coastline in California for birds, seals, et cetera. Muir Beach should continue to be shared by everyone.\"\nThe long-awaited final ruling   due in late 2015   could set a wide-ranging precedent for dogs in national parks across the country.\n\"We are still on track for a decision next year, even with the extension,\" Levitt said.\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\nRead the plan\nCopies of the dog walking plan can be reviewed athttp://parkplanning.nps.gov/dogplan .", "author": "By Mark Prado", "title": "Comment on controversial Marin GGNRA dog leash plan gets extension"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "A fire in a pile of lumber behind the Travelodge in Mill Valley early Saturday morning was doused within minutes by the Mill Valley Fire Department.\nThe blaze broke out shortly after midnight and was first spotted by a Mill Valley police officer patrolling the Redwood Highway frontage road.

I held back on doing so because, like the bad guy in the old spaghetti westerns, the darn thing just wouldn't roll over and die. It just kept writhing and spewing out yet another \"I'm not ready for the wrecking ball\" epitaph.\nIt probably started when it stood up to the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, and it's been sticking out its figurative tongue at us ever since. \nEven now it clings to life, hoping that some weird combination of wins and losses today will give it yet another encore before the fat lady really does sing.\nAlmost 54 years is not a particularly long lifespan unless you consider that Candlestick Park seemed to be 40 years old when it was built. Much as I didn't believe anything that Richard Nixon said when he was president, so, too, did I not believe him when the then-vice president threw out the first pitch on opening day 1960 and declared, \"This will be one of the most beautiful parks of all time.\"\nI was there on opening day of 1960 as well, selling seat cushions on the walkway behind home plate. I remember saying to Dick Quinlan, my fellow seat hawker that day, a rather different take than Mr. Nixon. My comments went something like, \"What a (expletive) dump.\" Also unlike Mr. Nixon, I had no aspirations to be president.\nIt was no secret, even before the park was built, that Candlestick Point was one of the windiest spots in San Francisco. And, any longtime San Franciscan who was even on the periphery of city politics would tell you that the entire process was a political boondoggle. Charles Harney, the contractor who had the ear of the powers that be, insisted the street leading to the ballpark be named for him, a modest touch I thought.\nAnd yet, in its early incarnation, there was still a certain mom-and-pop shop feel about it. My cushion-selling boss was a troll-like creature who I'm convinced hadn't left the cushion room since Lefty O'Doul played for the San Francisco Seals at Seals Stadium, and only arrived at Candlestick Park in an upside down crate marked \"This end up.\"\nWhen I got into the sports broadcasting business a few years later, the press box and press lunchroom were filled with characters that would have made Damon Runyon jealous. Beer was served all day in the press box and many of the beat writers were adept at timing their consumption with their deadlines. If a game went into extra innings there were a lot of typos in the morning paper.\nThe son of the team's owner would sit in the press box and was always there to answer questions. So long as it was prior to the sixth inning at about which time he would nod off from partaking of the press box offerings.\nLon Simmons   one of my favorite all time people   was calling the games next to the great Russ Hodges, and the announce booth had holes in the metal flooring for ventilation   below which freezing fans would partake of smoking the herbal sustenance now legal in Colorado.\nOne particularly chilly night at the 'Stick, Lon turned to Russ midgame and said, \"I don't know about you Russ, but I feel a lot better now than when I walked in here three hours ago.\"\nI was there when Dwight Clark made the Catch, I was there when Willie McCovey's ninth inning line drive was caught by the Yankee's Bobby Richardson ending the 1962 World Series, and I was there when Juan Marichal threw a two-hit shutout in his first major league appearance. I saw the greatest player to ever don a uniform (in my humble opinion), Willie Mays. I saw Joe Montana and Jerry Rice, Steve Young and Ronnie Lott. I even saw the Beatles there.\nAnd it all wasn't because of Candlestick Park; it was in spite of it.\nA big part of my life will come crashing down when that wrecking ball first hits, but the good news is I get to keep the memories.\nThe better news is, I get to be warm.\nBarry Tompkins is a longtime sports broadcaster who lives in Marin.

But, like me, you'd think wrong.\nThat all changes next weekend when, 43 years after they blew Lone Star minds with Dead-style progressive rock, the Greezy Wheels, recent inductees into the Austin Music Hall of Fame, make their Marin debut in a free afternoon show on Jan. 19 at Rancho Nicasio. \nThe day before, they're happily doing another gratis gig, this one at San Francisco's Jammin on Haight, a nouveau hippie boutique on the corner of Haight and Masonic that bills itself as \"the center of the tie-dye universe.\"\nIt will be a nostalgic moment for the band's founder, 66-year-old singer-songwriter-guitarist Cleve Hattersley, a New Yorker who was part of the hippie horde that colonized the Haight Ashbury in the '60s.\n\"It has always been a dream of mine to play out there, anywhere,\" he said from his home in Austin. \"And to be able to play a free show, right on Haight Street, in a tie-dye store ...\" he said, his voice blissfully trailing off at the perfect synchronicity of it all.\nAfter the Summer of Love, Hattersley left San Francisco and moved to Texas to deal marijuana, a short-lived occupation that earned him a seven-year prison sentence.\nHe formed the Greezy Wheels during the 2\u03a9 years his case was on appeal. They were an overnight sensation, becoming the house band at Armadillo World Headquarters, a legendary music hall that presented everyone from AC/DC and Asleep at the Wheel to ZZ Top and Frank Zappa.\n\"We became pretty big pretty quickly,\" Hattersley recalled. \"By the time I had to turn myself in, fans were wearing T-shirts that said, 'Free Greezy.'\"\nAfter losing his appeal, he did his time in the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville, a pen notorious for having the most active execution chamber in the U.S. While behind bars, he was chosen to play in the band that performs at the prisoners' annual rodeo.\n\"They made us wear stripes,\" he recalled with a groan. \"It was really sick, man.\"\nHattersley thanks powerful friends in Austin for persuading the governor to commute his sentence, freeing him after serving just 11 months. During his unfortunate incarceration, the band's co-founders, his wife of 40 years, noted fiddle player \"Sweet\" Mary Hattersley, and his singing sister, Lissa Hattersley, kept the Wheels rolling.\nIn 1975, they recorded their debut London Records album at the Record Plant in Sausalito, appeared on the first season of \"Austin City Limits\" and were stars in a flourishing scene that gave rise to the likes of Willie Nelson, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jerry Jeff Walker and Delbert McClinton. Along with the Grateful Dead, they were one of the first of what we now know as jam bands.\n\"Like the Dead, our songs tended to go on for a long time,\" Hattersley explained.\nIn 1978, frustrated by losing band members to other groups, he disbanded the Wheels and went to New York for several years to manage the famed Lone Star Cafe, an urban cowboy outpost in Manhattan where the Wheels had been a popular headliner. With that experience behind him, he was later hired to run the renowned Blue Note jazz club.\nAfter returning to Texas, he managed several name musicians, most notably Kinky Friedman, running Friedman's first gubernatorial campaign.\n\"He was the first independent candidate to ever get on the ballot,\" Hattersley said. \"We got 16 percent of the vote. I'm pretty proud of that.\"\nHe is currently running Friedman's bid to become Texas Agricultural Commissioner on (wait for it) a marijuana legalization platform.\n\"I've always been an advocate of pot reform,\" he said, chuckling.\nIn 2000, he and his wife revived the Wheels after she was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\"We realized we didn't want to do anything else but play the music we always wanted to play,\" he explained.\nIn addition to Hattersley, his wife and sister, the current lineup features backup singer Penny Jo Pullus, a rhythm section of drummer John Bush and bassist Brad Houser, formerly of the New Bohemians, plus keyboardist Matt Hubbard from Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann's band 7 Walkers.\nThey have performed regularly in Texas and have ventured as far as Woodstock, N.Y., to play a couple of the late Levon Helms' Midnight Rambles. Since reforming, they've released five independent albums, the most recent, 2013's \"Kitty Cat Jesus.\"\nReviewing one of their CDs, Margaret Moser wrote in the Austin Chronicle that it \"picks up where Dan Hicks and the Hot Licks left off, but ditches the novelty edge in favor of sly Texas ambiance.\"\nAnd in Texas Monthly, reviewer John Morthland wrote, \"It rocks, it rolls and sometimes it does both at once.\"\nContact Paul Liberatore via email atliberatore@marinij.com ; follow him on Twitter athttp://twitter.com/LibLarge .

Forget what happened last time. That's what Redwood High grad and Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll says.\nThe Seahawks dismantled Saturday's divisional-round playoff opponent the New Orleans Saints 34-7 on Dec. 2. The 188 yards the Saints gained that day were the fewest under head coach Sean Payton, who has been running the team since 2006, save last season, when he was suspended.\nBut, never mind that, Carroll says. This is a new week in a new situation. \n\"It has nothing to do with what happened before,\" Carroll said. \"We learned and we gained information in the game, as they did. We start all over again. Take a look at what's happened since we played them. Compare the build-up, what have they done coming into the game, what did they do, what's happened since then. I think it'd be a mistake to try to call (the result) because of what's happened in the past and all that. We don't care about that.\"\nThe Saints do. Following their 26-24 win Saturday night over the Philadelphia Eagles, New Orleans players immediately spoke of retribution for the December dismantling.\n\"It was embarrassing, humbling. It was all of the above, I guess you could say,\" Jimmy Graham told reporters after the Philadelphia game. \"I certainly won't ever forget that moment. And now we have a great opportunity to prove ourselves against one of the best teams in the NFL. It's gonna be a battle, that's for sure.\"\nLocking down Graham, the Saints Pro-Bowl tight end, was a key part to the first game. Graham had just three catches on nine targets for 42 yards.\nHe wasn't alone in his ineffectiveness. Almost everything the Saints tried did not work. They scored a season-low seven points. Drew Brees threw for a season-low 147 yards, 160 yards fewer than New Orleans' season average. The last time he threw for less than 200 yards was Jan. 2, 2011.\nThe Saints were 25th in rushing yards this season, but have looked to change things up lately. Against the Eagles, the Saints ran 36 times and passed 30. That's a drastic shift in philosophy, especially considering their lead back, Pierre Thomas (chest), did not play. Bowling-ball back Mark Ingram carried a season-high 18 times for 97 yards against Philadelphia's 10th-ranked rushing defense.\n\"It could have been because of that offense, the conditions and all of that,\" Carroll said. \"We'll have to see how that figures into our game.\"\nWhen Shayne Graham kicked a 32-yard field goal as time expired Saturday night, he sent Carroll and staff to work. The Seahawks have faced the Saints twice at CenturyLink Field since Carroll was hired in 2010. Neither are good memories for the Bayou bunch.\nThe first was a 41-36 loss in a wild-card game notable for Marshawn Lynch's \"Beast quake\" run. Brees was 39 for 60 for 404 yards in that game, when the Seahawks' All-Pro secondary was still developing. Richard Sherman hadn't been drafted yet, Earl Thomas was a rookie and Kam Chancellor was splitting time with Lawyer Milloy.\nLess was at stake earlier this season during Monday Night Football with the Seahawks coming off a bye week. The Saints had more first downs (3) from Seahawks penalties than they did rushing (2), despite have Thomas playing at the time. Thomas gained zero yards on four carries.\nThose are points of reference but not reliance for Carroll. He's not going to assume his players automatically realize the earlier result should be jettisoned.\n\"There's no automatics here,\" Carroll said. \"They're going to hear about it. I think it's just common knowledge that it's human nature   you'd like to think that it's going to be the same, but we know better than that. We have to respect this opportunity for what it is. It's a great championship matchup for us. They're going to come loaded up and give us a great football game.\"\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll, left, laughs as he stands near tackle Paul McQuistan (67) during stretching drills before NFL football practice, Friday, Jan. 3, 2014, in Renton, Wash.

What idiot did that? I thought.\nMy stomach turned inside out when I realized the eye of the storm was my trash can. Moments before, it had been filled to the brim with the pink packing material, which had cradled my mother's china on its sentimental journey from California to Florida.\nThe trash men had just been by. It was a windy day. And I had instantly become \nthat neighbor! I can't stand people like me.\nI dashed down the street and began chasing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pink peanuts, asking myself that for the zillionth time: How did I get into this mess? (Yes, I know smartypants. I should have put the peanuts in a drawstring garbage bag, but I didn't. OK?)\nIt all started just before Thanksgiving. I was setting the holiday table, and suddenly got choked up. A wistful wave of nostalgia washed over me as I flashed on all those holiday dinners around my mother's table on her delicate, ivory china with its hand-painted gold pattern.\nNow dad's gone. Mom's in a rest home, and I'm 3,000 miles away trying to make my own meaningful traditions. The family china was sitting in a box in my brother's garage in California waiting for me to claim it.\nLast spring, some of you will recall, I cleared out my parents' home, selling and donating their furnishings. I brought home a few items   some jewelry, glassware, an oil painting   but held off on the silver and china. I wasn't ready emotionally (the memories!) or physically (where to put it!) to deal with the 12 place settings.\nBut as I set the Thanksgiving table, I did some mental math, which sounds like a hand-crank pencil sharpener, and figured that I have likely had more Thanksgivings than I will have.\nForget what anyone tells you. This is the definition of mid-life. And it is a crisis. Suddenly, my desire for mom's china became a stage-five obsession not seen since the days of my pregnancy cravings: I need a barbecue chicken pizza NOW!\n\"Please, send the china,\" I said to my sister-in-law over the phone. She took the boxes straight to Art Ono, owner of the UPS store in Culver City, who promptly panicked.\nIf you want to send a shipper's vital signs into the ozone, just say, \"heirloom china.\" An all-points bulletin goes out to delivery trucks nationwide, and the entire transportation network goes on red alert. No two boxes of china can travel on the same truck for the same reason that the president and vice president can't fly together. Then the packer corners the market on pink peanuts.\nOno, a certified packing expert, and his crew, who happen to be his kids, took the heirloom china job as seriously as a brain tumor. Several days later, I received three boxes the size of Smart cars, and a smaller fourth box, which held the silver.\nThe boxes were so thoroughly packed you could have dropped them from a freeway overpass, and had them knocked around by speeding traffic, and the dishes would have been intact. Only delivery by armored car could have offered more protection.\nMy Christmas table was a beautiful, if sentimental, blend of old and new, mom's gold-rimmed china with my plain ivory, her silver with my crystal. I discarded the packaging.\nAnd that is how, one recent morning, for love, for family, and so I wouldn't make the neighbors mad, I was trolling through neighbors' yards and the streets like a stray dog, chasing that which was fleeting.\nHere is how Ono says you, too, can wrap and pack fragile valuables like a pro:\n*\nPad all parts: When shipping breakables, individually wrap each piece with bubble wrap until you can't feel any edges, said Ono, who used several layers of small-bubble wrap on each dish. Next put a layer of peanuts on the bottom of the box. Layer in wrapped dishes so they're not touching, add another layer of peanuts, then more dishes. Once filled, overstuff the box with more peanuts so nothing moves.\n*\nBox the box: Ono then put that box in another box, two inches bigger all around, and filled the gap with more peanuts.\n*\nAssume rough handling: When packages ship by ground, they typically go from truck to truck, and \"can be thrown around quite a bit,\" said Ono, \"even when they say fragile.\" Picture boxes being dropped from a height of three feet, and pack accordingly.\n*\nNix the newspaper: The most common mistakes Ono sees self-packers make are wrapping breakables in paper, and leaving too much room in the box. \"When you grab a box you shouldn't feel contents moving,\" he said. \"But customers bring their china in that way and think it's ready to ship.\" UPS is good about honoring insurance, but often want to inspect the packing to see why an item broke. \"If it's because the sender didn't pack properly, it's not UPS's fault.\"\n*\nInsure it: With UPS, each box is automatically insured for $100. For $1.50 more per box you can buy an additional $100 of protection.\n*\nSticker shock: This kind of packing doesn't come cheap. Ono said he can usually pack eight place settings of dishes in two boxes, and charges $100 per box. Shipping and insurance get added to that. To pack, ship and insure our four boxes cost $500. When I asked Ono if perhaps he over packed, he asked me, \"Was anything broken?\" No, I told him. \"Then the job was perfect,\" he said. Can't argue with that.\nSyndicated columnist Marni Jameson is the author of \"House of Havoc\" and \"The House Always Wins\" (Da Capo Press).

But she has her students learning a whole new way.\nThis past week her class, made up of fourth- and fifth-graders, did reports on the book, \"The Sign of the Beaver,\" from which they each explained how a symbol in the story represented the relationship between the two main characters.\nThey prepared their reports on Keynote   Apple's software equivalent to Microsoft PowerPoint   using iPads. Through a wireless communication between the students' iPads and O'Donnell's Apple TV, each presentation was beamed, one after another, onto the screen at the front of the room. \n\"Instead of doing paper-pencil tasks, they're allowed to have an iPad in front of them,\" O'Donnell said. \"It's making sure the students are more engaged in the projects they're creating.\"\nWhile not every classroom has iPads at its disposal, schools throughout Marin County and the country are rapidly becoming more digitized, turning to computers and online programs to teach lesson plans. That's increasing the demand for stronger Internet connections, or greater bandwidth, to support that increased use.\nBandwidth is basically a measurement of how much information an Internet connection can access at any given time.\nDemand \"has grown dramatically in the last couple years,\" said Doug Lancaster, director of information technology for the County Office of Education. \"All of our districts are clamoring for additional bandwidth, just because of the demand that is required to effectively use online tools.\"\nMeeting that demand is an expensive endeavor, which adds yet another cost to tightly strapped education budgets.\nMost schools in the country benefit from federal-mandated subsidies offered through the E-rate program, which in the current fiscal year has up to $2.4 billion to aid schools with costs associated with Internet service.\nInternet connectivity is generally less of a problem in more urban areas, where the infrastructure for electronic communication is more robust. But, much like cellphone coverage, Internet connections are often less reliable in more rural areas.\nThat is why Rep. Jared Huffman, D-San Rafael, along with about two dozen other members of Congress, wrote a letter last month to the FCC, which oversees the E-rate program. Legislators are pushing to modernize and expand broadband Internet connections, particularly in more rural areas.\nFor Huffman, much of the thrust is to improve Internet access in the northern reaches of his congressional district, which extends all the way to the Oregon border.\nIn places such as Mendocino and Trinity counties, \"You've got broadband deserts, basically,\" Huffman said.\nBut the appeal to the FCC is in support of all schools, no matter how well-wired some classrooms are.\n\"We're seeing a lot of new innovations in education, and some of it involves remote learning,\" Huffman said. \"That obviously requires cutting-edge, broadband technology.\"\nOfficials in the Lagunitas School District, which serves the San Geronimo Valley, say their two schools need more bandwidth. The district of 300 students is keeping pace with the integration of technology in classrooms, making computers part of the regular classroom experience.\nBut any learning exercises that rely on the school's Internet access are at the mercy of a spotty connection.\n\"It's hard when you have a classroom of students all ready to start a project, and a slow Internet connection is holding them up,\" said Laura Shain, principal of both Lagunitas district schools. \"As we look forward, we are purchasing more computers and integrating technology even further, so we will probably see more interruptions\" due to a slow Internet connection.\nThat could become particularly problematic next school year, when Common Core curriculum testing is fully implemented, Shain said. The state's new standardized testing will be done on computers, with the use of the Internet. If Lagunitas doesn't have adequate Internet service by then, that could cause problems with the testing process, Shain said.\nWhether it's increasing bandwidth or helping school districts save money, the E-rate program benefits schools throughout the county.\nThe amount of money a district receives is based, in part, on the number of its students who qualify for free school lunches   an easy way to measure a district's number of low-income students. So, wealthier districts receive less financial help for their Internet systems   somewhere on the order of 20 percent of related expenditures.\nThe San Rafael City Schools District, which has more low-income students, will have 70 percent of its telecommunications costs this school year covered by E-rate money, saving the district more than $220,000. Novato Unified School will have $80,000 of its $140,000 costs covered by E-rate.\n\"Some significant dollars are being realized from E-rate,\" Lancaster said.\nBut as classrooms become increasingly more geared toward learning with computers and the Internet, the demand for dollars is likely to go up as well.\n\"Certainly we're trying to send the message that this is an important thing to consider,\" Lancaster said, \"that we would not only like to maintain what we have, but also increase funds, because demand continues to increase.\"\nContact Laith Agha via email atlagha@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Hannah Morgan and Owen J.

In actual numbers, it estimates 14,000 illegal immigrants live in Marin.\nI suspect that figure is now quite a bit higher since the Obama administration has refused to secure our borders and the politicians in Sacramento also are not doing anything to stop the flow of illegal immigrants into California.\nInstead, they pass laws allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.\nIs something wrong with this picture?\nAssume that each illegal immigrant has a household of six. That's 2,333 rental units occupied by illegal immigrants. Simple supply and demand is at work here   less supply, the higher the rents.\nBefore anyone jumps to conclusions, I am not a racist, I'm simply pointing out the facts.\nJ.M.

These wreaths make me smile as I come home at the end of the day.\nThe wreaths aren't part of any formal town or chamber holiday decoration program but are put up every year by a Cascades area resident   an anonymous holiday gift to the community.\nI want to publicly say thank you to that individual.

Leave that to the small-time, gutter press, such as the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal.\nLeave it to researchers from Harvard, MIT, Columbia,and the Kaiser Family Foundation, obviously mouthpieces for the right wing.\nDon't you realize who you really serve?

I really must take issue with her slur that the IJ is \"way too right-wing stupid.\" If she really reads and digests what is on the pages of the paper she will find that the IJ is neither \"stupid\" nor \"right wing.\"\nIt is a liberal news organization that would do well to work on being a little more fair and balanced.

The bridge district operates the ferry system. \nDwight Steeves of San Rafael, who sits on the district's Ferry Passenger Advisory Committee, said he is concerned about the plan. He questions the relatively small amount of money that would be generated in the face of a multi-million-dollar deficit and views the fee as an impediment to taking public transit.\n\"The whole idea of charging for parking makes people less inclined to take the ferry,\" he said. \"You want to make public transit as inexpensive as possible, not put up obstacles.\"\nBut officials say the new system will be easy to use, relying on a mobile payment system instead of a crossing arm and a machine distributing tickets.\n\"The system will be license plate-based,\" said Mary Currie, spokeswoman for the bridge district. \"There will be someone at the terminal to go around and make sure people paid by checking plates.\"\nRiders who don't pay can get dinged with a $45 fine.\nThe district will use the \"Parkmobile\" mobile payment system. Customers register for free and pay via the Internet, a toll-free telephone service or by downloading a mobile app for the iPhone, Android, Windows or Blackberry smartphones.\nParkmobile transactions are linked to the license plate number of the vehicle parking in the lot. There would be no need to display tickets on a dashboard or require a parking stall number assignment. The app would be used for up to two years in a pilot program. There also will be options for people who prefer to pay by cash.\nThe first-ever parking charge at the lot is expected to generate $400,000 a year for the cash-strapped district, which has a $142 million, five-year deficit. It is also looking at raising bridge tolls.\nThe fee will be in effect from 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. weekdays. The fee would not be collected on weekends or on seven holidays. The district will offer a $20 monthly parking pass. That would drop the fee to $1 a day.\nBridge officials are looking to implement the fee as a way to generate revenue and encourage people to find other ways to the ferry terminal beyond parking at the lot. There are 1,800 spaces provided to ferry riders and all those are often filled by 8:30 a.m. weekdays. The district now runs a pilot shuttle   The Wave   out of the Ross Valley to the terminal.\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Clouds reflect in the windshields of parked cars at the Larkspur Ferry Terminal on Monday, Dec. 17, 2012, in Larkspur, Calif.

This is all from me and a couple of my clients,\" said the Ross resident, who started the fund in January 2013.\nThe first beneficiary of the fund was Michelle Knight, one of three Cleveland, Ohio women held captive for more than a decade. Knight, who vanished in 2002 at the age of 20, was rescued in May 2013 from the Cleveland house where she was imprisoned, raped and abused.\n\"The first chunk of our money went to Michelle to pay her rent,\" said McLaughlin, who sent Knight a check for $6,000 in July. Knight, estranged from her mother, had nowhere to go after she was rescued.\n\"I have a beautiful hand-printed note from Michelle,\" McLaughlin said. \"She said she was honored and 'eternally grateful' for the grant. She said the money 'made it possible for me to stay at a home where I feel safe, secure and cared for.'\n\"I put that note on my bulletin board in the kitchen. I look at it every morning,\" McLaughlin said.\n\"I had a baby who passed away, but at least I had a chance to say goodbye to her. These parents (of missing children) don't ever have a chance to say goodbye,\" the agent added.\nMcLaughlin, a lifelong Ross resident, has three surviving children, Ross, 20, who is in business school in Colorado; Whitney, 15, a student at Marin Catholic High School; and Grace, 14, a student at Ross Elementary School.\n\"I was thinking about starting a charity for a long time (before the fund),\" McLaughlin said. \"I've been successful in my career and I wanted to do something to give back.\"\nSeeing a television program on missing children led her to call Klaas, who she knew through his wife Violet, the manager of Pacific Union's Kentfield office.\n\"I said, 'If these children are abducted, who helps the parents financially? I imagine they are immobilized,' and he said, 'There is nothing to help them.'\"\n\"I thought it was a great idea,\" said Klaas, who in the aftermath of the 1993 kidnap and murder of his 12-year-old daughter Polly gave up a high-powered career to pursue an aggressive child safety agenda.\nKlaas worked with McLaughlin to establish the fund. Donations to Klaas Family Housing are tax-deductible because it is a program of the Sausalito-based KlaasKids Foundation, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. The foundation was established in 1994 to create a legacy in the name of Polly Klaas. Its mission is to stop crimes against children.\nReferring to the housing fund, \"We still have plenty of money in the fund and we are actively looking for another recipient, someone we can help. We were very, very happy to help her (Knight),\" Klaas said.\n\"When I saw the note she wrote, it had one of the most unbelievable lines I've ever heard, considering the context.

(Carolina's game-winning FG drive in the fourth quarter started in 49ers' territory after a good Ted Ginn Jr. punt return.)\nAnd I think the 49ers offense is far better than it was in that game   it has Michael Crabtree in the line-up this time, and it has Colin Kaepernick playing at a higher level (and probably healthier) than he was back then.\nblogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami/", "author": "Bay Area News Group", "title": "Combing the blogs: 49ers have a slight edge heading into Sunday's game"}, {"relevance": [115.25], "text": "Saturday's local events\nCOLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nCOM at Merritt           7:30 p.m.           Oakland\nCOLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nCOM at Merritt           5:30 p.m.           Oakland\nHIGH SCHOOL BOYS BASKETBALL           Time           Place \nBay Area: Marin Academy at Bay           11 a.m.           San Francisco\nBranson at Novato           7:30 p.m.           Novato\nJustin-Siena at Marin Catholic           7:30 p.m.           Kentfield\nRedwood at San Marin           7:30 p.m.           San Marin\nTerra Linda at San Rafael           7:30 p.m.           San Rafael\nDrake at Tam           7:30 p.m.           Mill Valley\nHIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nBay Area: San Domenico vs. Urban           3:30 p.m.           International Bay Area: Marin Academy vs. Bay           3:30 p.m.           San Francisco\nRedwood at San Marin           6 p.m.           San Marin\nBranson at Novato           6 p.m.           Novato\nJustin-Siena at Marin Catholic           6 p.m.           Kentfield\nDrake at Tam           6 p.m.           Mill Valley\nTerra Linda at San Rafael           6 p.m.           San Rafael\nHIGH SCHOOL WRESTLING           Time           Place\nRedwood at Clayton Valley Invitational           TBA           Concord San Rafael girls at Napa Valley Classic           9 a.m.           Vintage High\nsunday's local events\nNo events scheduled\nON THE AIR saturDAY\nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL           Time           TV           Radio\nSt. Louis at Dayton           8 a.m.           ESPN2\nIowa State at Oklahoma           9 a.m.           ESPNU\nNorth Carolina at Syracuse           9 a.m.           ESPN           1050 AM\nSt. Bonaventure at UMass           9:30 a.m.           NBCS\nFlorida at Arkansas           10 a.m.           ESPN2\nTexas Christian at Baylor           10:30 a.m.           Ch. 20\nKansas State at Kansas           11 a.m.           ESPN\nMissouri at Auburn           11 a.m.           ESPNU\nTulane at North Texas           11 a.m.           CSN\nRhode Island at G.

His friends began to sing \"Happy Birthday\" as he entered the Marin Bocce Federation on B Street and was stopped every few feet to receive a hug. \nSaccone said his son-in-law Bob Albertazi pulled a fast one on him, casually asking him whether he wanted to go play bocce in the afternoon. He had no idea a lavish surprise party had been in the works for weeks.\n\"I didn't have the least bit of a clue and I almost didn't come,\" Saccone said. \"If there ever was a camouflage, this is it.\"\nThe centenarian, whose official birthday is Monday, was so thrilled that he couldn't even sit down or touch the huge spread of food prepared by his friends until he came down from what he described as \"cloud nine.\"\nSaccone is well known in the community for founding United Markets with his brother in 1955, which he turned over to two of his store managers in the 1990s. He founded the grocery after serving with Gen. George Patton's Third Army during World War II. He's a veteran of many Marin civic organizations, including the Marin Italian Athletic Club and the Marin Bocce Federation.\nRaffaele Salvemini, of San Rafael, has Italian roots like Saccone and helped him open markets in Mill Valley, Rohnert Park and San Anselmo. The two men have known each other for more than 40 years and Salvemini said he had a wonderful boss, who he now also plays bocce with.\n\"Joe was always hands-on. He'd always come in and ask how it was going,\" Salvemini said. \"I have a lot of respect for him.\"\nPlaying bocce is a way of life for Saccone, who plays at least three times a week and has the type of hand-eye coordination athletes dream of. He helped open the bocce club in 1994, but the sport truly became an all-encompassing activity after his wife of 72 years, Elda Rita Saccone, died in 2012.\n\"I'm just sad my wife isn't here,\" Saccone said, wishing she'd been part of his party.\nBoth Saccone and his late wife are treasured members of the club and known for winning all the gold medals in tournaments. Many of his friends said he's simply too good at the sport, and they wouldn't dare play him for money.\nTom Miller, of Novato, said Saccone plays to win, but he does so in such a friendly and courteous manner.\n\"He's a role model for anyone around him,\" Miller said. \"He's an exceptional human being.\"\nDieter Vielhauer, of San Rafael, agreed.\n\"He's made a real impression on everybody. He's a real sincere and friendly gentleman,\" Vielhauer said.\nFor Nancy Martino, of Novato, Saccone is the man who taught her how to play bocce about eight years ago. She said his guidance has been greatly appreciated.\n\"He's an absolute good sport and it's hard to beat him,\" Marino said.\nAs Saccone made his way around the party, receiving kiss after kiss from all the women in attendance who claimed he is a huge flirt, his daughter Noella Albertazi reflected on how amazing it is that her father is so loved.\n\"Is there anybody he doesn't know?\" Albertazi said. \"It's humbling and it's fun. I feel good when I'm around him and he has the funniest stories.\"\nAlbertazi and her husband moved from Lake Tahoe to San Rafael after her mother died, helping her father take care of his house and himself. She said last week her father had a wonderful pre-birthday celebration when all of his grandchildren were in town. And what did the family do? Play bocce, of course.\n\"Grandpa ran the bocce clinic and the final game came down to a team with his two little granddaughters on it. They were screaming and jumping up and down. He had a ball,\" Albertazi said.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

Gatti is participating as a member of the steering committee and as an artist. Proceeds will benefit the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. \n\"San Francisco is a small town but is also a place of innovation and industrial design,\" Gatti proudly points out. He cites the city's gastronomical achievements (\"No one can touch us for food!\") and includes in his geographical spread the Bay Area regions between the Wine Country and Silicon Valley.\n\"We've always been the melting pot of creativity,\" he says. \"FOG Design + Art just wants to bring San Francisco to the forefront of the design world. It's good for the people living here, too. It brings visitors to into hotels, restaurants and shops.\"\nIt will be the \"perfect place to become inspired,\" says Denise Lamott, spokeswoman and Muir Beach resident. \"There will be nearly 40 of the nation's top artists, designers and dealers from San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Dallas and Chicago showcasing vintage and contemporary modern design, art, fashion, fine home furnishings, lighting and books.\"\nThere will be panel discussions and talks with modernists such as Craig Dykers, a principal of Snohetta, the architectural firm in charge of the SFMOMA's expansion, and Ron Arad, a London-based architect and designer.\n\"Ron Arad is just one of the innovators that anyone who has an interest in design should know about,\" says Gatti.\nThere also will be daily performances of Jurg Lehni's Hektor, a robotic artist that produces posters that resemble paint-splattered graffiti that will be for sale. For those who get hungry, there will be organic salads and soups, sandwiches, coffee, juices, wines and baked goods by Jane at the FOG Caf\u00c8.\nThen, there is Gatti's own installation called 21POP, a natural outgrowth of his upbringing in New Mexico where his mother loved to throw parties and his father handmade everything from her rolling pin to their dustpan and birdbath.\n\"We live in a time when the 10- to 14-year-olds think everything is made in China and bought on Amazon,\" he says. \"I want people to have an outlet to see many great craftsmen.\"\nSo, his exhibit is a kitchen made of plywood that will serve as a backdrop for the offerings of talented creators who have caught his eye   a new sustainable dishwashing soap (\"a cool boutique product,\" he promises) from San Francisco's Heliotrope; copper pots and ladles from a North Carolina artist; and from another artisan, \"the most beautiful mortar and pestles you've ever seen.\"\nThe centerpiece, however, will be the launch of a packaged pasta   fresh and dried   line by former Mill Valley residents Michael and Lindsay Tusk of the San Francisco restaurants Quince and Cotogna.\n\"Because it's them, the pasta will be perfect every time,\" he insists.\n\"There will be so many cool things to see, just like a well-curated store or a well-appointed house,\" Gatti concludes. \"It will be just a whole lot of beauty.\"\nPJ Bremier may be contacted atpj@pjbremier.com .\nif you go\nWhat: San Francisco FOG Design +Art\nWhen: Gala preview, 6 to 9 p.m. Jan. 16; FOG Design + Art, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Jan. 17 and 18, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Jan. 19\nWhere: Festival Pavilion, Fort Mason, 2 Marina Blvd., San Francisco\nAdmission: $15 online atfogfair.com or $20 at the door; gala preview $150 and up\nInformation: 551-5190;fogfair.com\nMore: The FOG Fair Design + Art exhibitor catalog is online atartsy.net\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Courtesy of Stanlee R.

At least that's been the experience of the seven Marin women who make up Rita & the Cosmos.\n\"My dad was a real ham. He could imitate Al Johnson like nobody's business,\" says Rita Gershengorn, who founded the a capella singing group in 2005. \"My sister and my parents and I would sing all the time.\" \nAs a third-grade teacher and chorus director at Brandeis Hillel Day School in San Rafael for more than 20 years, Gershengorn was used to leading 5- to 9-year-olds in song, although she also wrote and performed music and parodies for adults all her life.\nWhen the 70-year-old San Rafael mother of two and grandmother of three retired, she was eager to find a group of musically minded women with whom she could sing. She didn't have to search too long or hard; the first three band members who joined her are the mothers of her former students.\nThe Cosmos, whose members range from their 50s to 70s, are \"adorable and sassy women,\" she says. \"We really have a good time together and it's obvious to the audience that we're enjoying ourselves and as a result they enjoy themselves as well.\"\nIn matching outfits from shimmering metallic to animal prints and with a collection of classics like \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" \"Cabaret,\" \"Yes Sir, That's My Baby\" and \"I Got the Sun in the Mornin',\" the group mostly performs at assisted living and nursing homes and is a regular at Atria Tamalpais Creek in Novato. They will perform Jan. 9 at the Belvedere-Tiburon Public Library for the first time.\n\"We know the names of the people and they know us,\" says Gershengorn, who arranges the 80 to 90 songs in their repertoire. \"We get the joy of performing, but they just love being taken back in time with the songs they remember.\"\n\"You can reach people through music. Some people can't be reached any other way,\" says Lauren Long of Novato, at 53 the youngest member of the Cosmos. \"It has a special connection for so many people.

Bobbi Bishop, 59, says she's become a better singer.\n\"In the last couple of years, Rita's had me singing harmony, which is new for me and so I'm keeping my little brain alive,\" jokes Bishop, who also grew up singing with her family.\nLong is happy to be learning more about harmony, too. But the geriatric physical therapist also loves that they group performs for elders. And, she says, the women are a heck of a lot of fun.\n\"They're like sisters. They're really showing me what the next phase can be like. They're very active,\" she says. \"They're fascinating women and busy living their lives in that stage I'm just about to launch into.\"\n\"They're a really caring group of ladies. We all have the same goal in mind, to bring some joy to people and to be perfect. We all work really hard at blending and getting the harmonies right,\" notes Bishop, a retired escrow officer.\nStill, they encourage seniors to sing along, \"even though sometimes it interferes with the perfection of our performance,\" Gershengorn says. \"It just means so much to them to capture all these words they probably didn't remember they had in their memory banks.\"\n\"We always have a packed house when Rita & the Cosmos play. It's one of our featured events,\" says Marc Johnson, Atria Tamalpais Creek's Engage Life director. \"Their performances are always new and fresh.\"\nPerforming for seniors has its hardships, however. Often they return to a place and someone has died. They began singing \"Sentimental Journey\" at the end of their performances in honor of a beloved World War II veteran who died a few years ago.\n\"When we started singing 'Sentimental Journal,' he was almost in tears. It was so painful to go there and he was gone,\" Gershengorn says.\nBut, she acknowledges, \"We're all on the same path.

That's one of the reasons why the city stepped up its crackdown on homeless camps. It's also a reason why Phillips says it is time for Marin to get serious about opening another emergency shelter.\nIn 2009, the Marin County grand jury studied the local homeless issue. It called for creation of a new shelter, but officials couldn't agree on a site or who should pay for it.\nInto this sad political limbo stepped local churches and synagogues that banded together to start an emergency winter shelter program that rotated among local parishes. The program, now in its sixth year, has been an admirable example of human compassion and community service.\nBut those parishes are talking about winding down their program in favor of officials finally getting serious about a new winter shelter.\nIn November, Mayor Phillips and Larry Meredith, the director of the county Department of Health and Human Services, shook hands and promised they would work toward opening a new shelter.\nCorte Madera's fire sent two clear messages.\nFirst, the grand jury called Marin's homeless population \"the 'invisible' problem that won't disappear.\" The report said that Marin's homeless are \"invisible,\" either by choice or because others would prefer to ignore the problem.\nThe Corte Madera fire is an example that the homeless aren't all that \"invisible.\" The fire could be seen for miles and firefighting squads from Corte Madera, Larkspur, San Rafael and Kentfield were needed to put out the blaze.\nIn fact, the fire department said a Sept. 27 fire nearby also was possibly started in a homeless camp.\nThe second message is that this is not just a San Rafael problem.\nSan Rafael and Novato may be the centers for shelters and services for local homeless, but it is a countywide issue that deserves countywide attention.\nWe hope that the pledge by San Rafael and the county to work toward opening a permanent winter shelter program really does move forward as a countywide initiative, not \"the county's responsibility\" or \"San Rafael's problem.\"\nLast week's fire should serve as another reminder that there is a need for a new shelter and meeting that need should not be mired in a debate over location.\nIn 2009, in response to the grand jury report, the Corte Madera Town Council responded that it was \"willing to consider participating in a joint effort.\" The town's \"commitment,\" the council wrote, \"will depend on the scope of the effort, the cost and the likelihood of effectiveness.\"\nThose are good places to start.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: A fire at a homeless encampment in Corte Madera near the Village shopping center burns Thursday, Jan. 2, 2014.

The North Marin Water District, which provides water to Novato and West Marin to 60,000 people, gets 80 percent of its water from Sonoma and the rest from Stafford Lake.\nComing out of a record dry year in 2013, officials are hoping to extend the Lake Sonoma supply as long as possible before it reaches a critical level.\nThe campaign will feature ads online in local broadcast and print outlets urging residents to conserve water, cutting down landscape irrigation, car washing, and other outdoor activities and publicizing existing programs to replace indoor appliances and fixtures with more efficient models.\nThis builds on an earlier campaign, over the summer, urging residents to take the \"20 gallon challenge,\" reducing their usage by that much every day. This new call, however, is much more urgent given the dire lack of precipitation in the rainy season so far.\nMarin just experienced its driest year on record. In 2013, 10.68 inches of rain were recorded at Lake Lagunitas, where the Marin Municipal Water District   which has data dating to 1879   keeps its official weather gauge.\nThe previous record low was set in 1929 when 19.06 inches of rain fell. The annual average is 52 inches per year.\nForecasters say there is a glimmer of hope for later this year, with some early signs that warming water in the Pacific may generate the condition known as \"El Ni\u00d2o\" that normally means wetter weather on the West Coast.\nIn the short term, however, the North Bay has little prospect of rain. The National Weather Service said this week that a weak weather system will move into the Pacific Northwest over the next few days, bringing a dusting of snow to the Sierra and rain to the upper Sacramento Valley as early as Saturday, but that is unlikely to generate much precipitation in Marin and Sonoma.\nThe wintertime conservation campaign is intended to save water now and get customers accustomed to drought conditions going into the summer, when demand peaks and Lake Sonoma will be under the most strain should the winter remain dry, said Grant Davis, general manager of the Sonoma County Water Agency.\nThe worst-case scenario, he said, would be to see water levels drop so low that the cities such as Novato can't get the water they need and flows in the river falls so low as to damage habitat for wildlife. \"And that is a real possibility ... we have to plan for that,\" he said.\nInformation on the drought situation and tips for conserving water are available atwateroff.org .\nDistributed by MCT Information Services.

The pastime can build character and it is not always supposed to be easy. Fishing may involve more watching of birds, marine mammals, traffic on a bridge and waves on the water than it might of interacting with fish.\nFishermen expect to be skunked at times, which makes the successful days all the more notable and gives meaning to \"big fish\" stories. All this tends to be especially true of sturgeon fishing, which can require a dozen or more slow and tedious hours of watching the rod tip before it dips toward the water   a bite! \nBut in the early days of 2014, sturgeon fishing has been unusually productive. San Rafael fisherman Ken Brown, along with his 15-year-old son   also named Ken   spent three days fishing together during the younger Brown's holiday vacation. The teenager caught a fish per trip, including two sturgeon as big as an angler can reasonably expect to catch in San Pablo Bay. One was an ideal   and legal   size to bring home and share at the table with his mother in Fair Oaks. One was the size of a man. One was even bigger.\n\"I had to make him understand that this is unusual,\" Ken Brown Sr. said. \"These were fish of a lifetime. He spent 10 days with me (visiting from his home in Sacramento County) and caught a seven- and an eight-foot sturgeon. How often does that happen?\"\nOn Dec. 30, the Browns caught and released the seven-footer, a spirited sturgeon that jumped several times before it was unhooked and released, and it was on Jan. 3 that they landed the 44-inch keeper.\nBut the big fish came in between, on Jan. 2. Most sturgeon cautiously, slowly, work on a bait. This registers at the rod tip as a famously subtle disturbance   a bob-bob-bob that novice anglers may never even notice as the sturgeon strips the hook and moves on. But this big sturgeon took the mud shrimp in what sturgeon fishermen call a \"suicide run.\" That is, it inhaled the bait and ran. Bat rays almost always take a bait this way. Also characteristic of a ray, the hooked fish immediately took about 600 feet of line, Brown Sr. said.\n\"I thought it was just a stingray,\" he said. \"It never jumped or anything, but my son said, 'Nah, it's a sturgeon   I can tell.'\"\nAfter almost 30 minutes of ambiguous resistance, the stubborn fish arrived at the side of the boat. It was clearly oversized, and the Browns unhooked it without removing it from the water. They marked the side of the boat at the tail and the head ends of the fish, which was unusually skinny, and later recorded an exact length: 102 inches, 81/2 feet long.\nWhere the Browns had success with size, other anglers have simply brought in large numbers of sturgeon. Sean Daugherty, a San Rafael fisherman, took several friends out of Loch Lomond Marina on New Year's Day. For two hours, the fishing was slow, as the tide wasn't yet moving. When the water began to surge out   it was one of the highest tides of the year   the bite began. One fish came in, then another and another. A keeper striped bass was taken, and a shaker was released. Sturgeon, one after another, sucked in the anglers' baits. At least one rod was bent toward the water for much of the afternoon, and for a few moments, Daugherty and one of his friends   Joe Sarmiento, writer of the SoCal Salty fishing blog   fought big sturgeon simultaneously. Big armored fish thrashed like crocodiles on the surface. It was, in popular terminology of star-struck anglers recovering from an action-packed day, epic.\nToward sundown, the first day of the 2014 sturgeon season was done. The tally: eight sturgeon and two striped bass. All fish except one striper were let go. The hot action persisted all week, and over a handful of trips Daugherty says he caught and released almost 30 sturgeon.\nBig tides in the coming week bode well for more fast action.\nAlastair Bland is a Bay Area fisherman.

Jerry Brown's proposed $106.8 billion general-fund budget that seeks to pay off a big chunk of the state's long-term debt while making modest investments in public schools, health care and the troubled bullet train.\n\"We're glad not to be dealing with cuts like what we've experienced in previous years,\" said Marin County Administrator Matthew Hymel. \nSaid Assemblyman Marc Levine: \"I applaud Gov. Brown's fiscal restraint while continuing our reinvestment in education.\"\nWhile the state's finances have improved significantly since the days of embarrassing, multibillion-dollar deficits, Brown said Thursday he believes the newfound fiscal stability could be short-lived and that restrained spending of scarce state resources is crucial.\nThe governor calls for spending $11 billion   or more than 10 percent of the total budget   to pay down $24.9 billion in remaining debts the state racked up during the previous decade. More than half of that money would be used to repay public schools, whose state aid payments were slashed by as much as 20 percent in recent years to balance the budget.\nHe also wants to put $1.6 billion in a \"rainy day fund\" that will help the state get through future recessions.\nBrown noted that when you include unfunded term pension obligations in the massive \"wall of debt,\" the total comes to about $355 billion.\n\"When you're at this level of long-term liability, it isn't time to just embark on a raft of new initiatives,\" Brown said at a Capitol news conference.\nHymel said county officials \"support the state's efforts to pay down their liabilities, as well as proposals to strengthen the state's rainy day fund to avoid boom and bust cycles in state funding.\"\nMary Jane Burke, Marin County superintendent of schools, said Brown's budget is \"very good for education across the state. The direction of reinvesting in public education is exactly what I think our children need.\"\nBurke added, however, \"I would want our community to be reminded though that it will be another seven years before public schools in our state are funded at the level they were funded during the 2007-08 year.\"\nShe said that educators were informed Wednesday during a meeting of the county's school superintendents that Marin schools will be losing close to $1 million in special education funding over the next two years due to federal sequestration cuts.\nIn a blog posting, Tamalpais Union High School District Superintendent Laurie Kimbrel wrote that her district will receive no increase in state funding, due to a new state formula for allocating education funds that was instituted last year.\nKimbrel wrote, \"The state revenue cuts we experienced during the recession will not be restored and our district will continue to rely almost exclusively on local funding.\"\nThe new formula introduced last year directs more money to schools with high numbers of lower-income students, English-learners and foster children.\nBrown's budget fails to address long-term liabilities in the state's teacher retirement fund, which will require billions of dollars extra a year to make solvent. Instead, Brown said he wants to create a plan for long-term solvency this year. The teachers' pension fund is estimated to be $80 billion in the red.\nWednesday's early-evening leaks of the budget to the media forced the Brown administration to move up a news conference scheduled for Friday morning. Brown was scheduled to promote his budget plan later Thursday in San Diego and Los Angeles to get maximum media exposure in an election year.\nThe governor also wants to commit $670 million in new money to the expansion of Medi-Cal benefits for mental health, substance abuse, adult dental and specialized nutrition coverage.\nLarry Meredith, director of the Marin County Department of Health and Human Services, welcomed the increased Medi-Cal funding.\n\"We're slowly clawing our way back to where we were before the Great Recession,\" Meredith said. \"It is a time of modest enthusiasm, but we're not breaking out the party favors yet because we want to know the details.\"\nThe state's $68 billion high-speed rail project, which has been snarled by recent court rulings that block the state's use of bond proceeds to fund the project, will also get a boost next fiscal year that could prove to be a lifeline, according to the governor's spending blueprint.\nBrown wants the bullet train to get $250 million generated by the state's landmark cap-and-trade law   and the controversial funding would continue for years. Another $600 million in fees this fiscal year would fund projects that reduce transportation emissions, increase energy efficiency and restore some state forests.\nThe independent Legislative Analyst's Office is projecting a $3.2 billion surplus for the next fiscal year and continued budget surpluses for the next several years.\nA daunting $27 billion deficit greeted Brown when he returned to the governor's office in January 2011   nearly three decades after he left the office. So he laid out an austere path riddled with billions of dollars in education and social service cuts that devastated his own Democratic constituencies.\nThe governor's cautionary approach is caused in part by the source of the state's revenue. His budget assumes about $4 billion in capital gains tax revenue, driven by the soaring stock market. But it also acknowledges that such income is highly volatile and will probably be short-lived.\nBrown's tax increases under Proposition 30   the tax measure voters approved in November 2012   will begin expiring later this decade: The state sales tax hike will last four years and the higher income taxes on those making more than $250,000 a year will last seven years.\nDespite Brown's call for budgetary prudence, the 8.5 percent increase in general fund spending over the current fiscal year includes additional money for nearly every area of state government. That includes $45.2 billion for K-12 schools, an increase of nearly $4 billion from the current fiscal year.\nThe University of California, California State University and community college systems will receive a total of $1.1 billion. About half the money would go to community colleges, which are expected to grow rapidly in the next few years.\nThe budget also proposes $815 million for critical deferred maintenance in state parks, highways, schools, courts and other state facilities, and $619 million to expand water storage capacity, improve drinking water supplies and increase flood protection.\nThe Associated Press and Independent Journal reporter Richard Halstead contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Gov.

Carly Holboke and Sarah Nelson each added 13 points while Lauren Hyatt and Noelle Roldan each chipped in 10 points apiece. Danielle Yamauchi dished out eight assists.\nDominican (2-12, 1-6 PacWest) had by far its best shooting night of the season, going 28-of-57 (49.1 percent) from the field. The Penguins also won the rebounding battle 41-33, with Hyatt leading all players with 11. That gave the senior center her second double-double of the season. Nelson and Quewon-Owens each pulled down eight boards apiece.\nThe first half was closely contested until Dominican took the lead, 19-17, with 6:43 to go. From there, the Penguins steadily built the lead to 42-32 at halftime. Dominican extended the lead to as large as 17 before the final buzzer sounded.\nDanna Lynn Hooper led the Seasiders (0-10, 0-4) with 18 points.\nDominican men fall\nLAIE, Hawaii   Devin Golston scored 18 points, but it wasn't enough as the Dominican University men's basketball team lost to host BYU-Hawaii 87-82.\nFellow seniors Myles Carrillo added 17 and Dominique Taplin added 16 points for the Penguins (11-5, 5-3 PacWest). Jonny Bates, who made the start, had six points but the Dominican bench combined for just eight points compared to the Seasiders (6-5, 4-1), whose reserves scored 46 points.\nRegulation consisted of two even 39-point halves by each squad. Hawaii's biggest lead was by four and the Penguins led by as much as 10 at one point, including by six with five and half minutes left in regulation. The Seasiders took a one-point lead inside of two minutes and free throws by both teams resulted in the game's 16th tie of the game to end regulation.\nAfter shooting 60 percent in the second half, Dominican went just 2 of 7 (.286) from the field while BYU-Hawaii made half of its attempts (3 of 6).\nCarrillo shot 7 of 14 from the field, dished out eight assists, and grabbed five rebounds before fouling out late in overtime. Haysbert led the Penguins with six rebounds and Golston and Taplin each reeled in five rebounds.\nFour Seasiders also reached double digits, led by 15 from Pablo Coro off of the bench. Scott Friel recorded a double-double with 11 points and a game-high 11 rebounds.

And now that they are older and go out on their own, we often hear, \"There's nothing to do in Novato   will you drive us to ...?\" \nWe drive to the bowling alleys in Petaluma and San Rafael, Cal-Skate in Rohnert Park, the ice rink in Santa Rosa, that inflatable bounce-house place in Cotati, the arcade in San Rafael and that laser-tag place in Rohnert Park.\nYears ago, we were driving them to Chuck E. Cheese in Rohnert Park.\nAnd all of those towns get our tax dollars, not Novato. And we combine shopping with trips.\nThe Target in Rohnert Park is big, clean and fully stocked and now there's a brand new one in Petaluma that's even nicer.\nWe also eat out a fair amount.\nIt seems Novato only has affordable Mexican restaurants or pizza places, and really expensive trendy restaurants, with almost nothing in between.\nSo we would love to see an \"entertainment complex\" along this corridor; with affordable restaurants, a bowling alley, a roller rink, etc. Someplace where kids and teens can go, along with families, couples on dates and maybe some people from other towns.\nWhy not bring some tax dollars into Novato rather than watching them leave?\nBecky O'Brien, Novato\nReasons to fear fracking\nCalifornians are in for a rude surprise if fracking is allowed to spread across the state.\nI should know; I was raised in Fort Worth and thanks to hydraulic fracturing I can never return to my family home again.\nIn Texas, homeowners don't own the mineral rights on or under their land, so companies came into counties all over the state and drilled the whole neighborhoods.\nMy parents were pushed out of the home they owned for the last 40 years due to the toxic fumes that bubbled up from the ground under their house.\nIf they kept their windows closed, their home would become a combustible bomb from all the gases percolating up from the ground.\nLocal officials warned parents not to let their children play outside, yet it's much worse if they stayed inside. My father had breathing problems and my mother had skin rashes that faded when they visited me in California.\nThey ultimately agreed to walk away from their home and move here.\nThe pollution from fracking isn't confined to well water alone. According to the EPA, it percolates up through the ground and creates a new kind of toxic smog filled with methane and all the chemicals used to fracture the shale that traps the natural gas drillers seek.\nEvidence suggests that earthquake activity is directly linked to fracking and California is prone to large temblors.\nWe should all support Assemblyman Marc Levine and stop hydraulic fracturing in Marin.\nMarla Burke, Kentfield\nA different attitude\nJust finished reading the highlights of touring Tasmania particularly an area called \"The Neck\" a popular tourist destination known for its epicurean contributions to neighboring Australia.\nAmong the major attractions on this strip of land are a cheese factory, vineyard and an oyster farm.\nThree things Marin has in its own backyard and yet, our federal government is doing all it can to dismantle the bivalve component. Ironic, no?\nGeorge Alboff, San Anselmo", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 10"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "I WANT TO RESPOND to inaccuracies in Jim Linford's Dec. 15 Marin Voice column, \"Oysters and wilderness can co-exist.\" Linford distorts the fundamental premise of the Wilderness Act by using the dubious technique of legitimizing one activity because another one of dubious value is permitted as well.\nBy noting livestock grazing and a few other exceptions that were \"grandfathered\" into the Wilderness Act, he tries to make it legal to permit other commercial enterprises like oyster farming to continue. From a purely legal perspective oyster farms have never been authorized by the Wilderness Act   though a small number of other commercial interests like livestock grazing were grandfathered in when the act was legislated. \nTwo wrongs do not make a right. Most ecologists, except those in the employ of the livestock industry, would readily acknowledge that livestock grazing has many negative impacts on the land, whether in wilderness or not. That such a destructive activity like livestock grazing is permitted in the places where we are supposed to be applying the highest standards of natural lands preservation does not make it permissible to indulge another industry like oyster farming.\nAllowing another commercial activity to continue when it clearly has negative ecological impacts on marine ecosystems does not make it OK.\nOne of the many values of wilderness is that it provides us with a \"control\" whereby we can judge how human extraction industries are negatively impacting things like natural marine systems. One of the first principles of science is the need for adequate controls   we have few marine reserves where commercial activities are prohibited. What better place than in a designated wilderness area?\nThe Wilderness Act clearly says that wilderness areas should be managed so as to \"leave them unimpaired for future use as wilderness, and so as to provide for the protection of these areas, the preservation of their wilderness character.\"\nClearly commercial activities like oyster farming are a domestication of the landscape. They distract and diminish the wilderness character, even if they have no known negative ecological impact. Known is an important qualifier. The precautionary principle is that in the absence of knowledge you default towards the goal of \"do no harm.\"\nFurthermore, as a lawyer, Linford knows that the context and the philosophical discussion that goes into the creation of such legislation like the Wilderness Act has much to do with interpretation of legality. The idea behind the Wilderness Act was to limit and reduce, not increase or even legitimize commercial extractive uses.\nFinally the owners of the oyster farm and their supporters conveniently neglect to mention that when these lands were designated as wilderness, the existing oyster farm was given a set period of time to operate when it was understood it would be removed. The Lunny family bought the farm with that knowledge and now appears unwilling to accept those well- known, legally binding legislative terms. Of course they try to dress up their own self-interest as some great social benefit as commercial interests always do.\nBut let us not be fooled. We need wild places more than we need one more oyster farm   especially more wild places in close proximity to urban populations. Removal of the oyster farm is one step towards the goal of restoring wildness to the land.\nIt is a worthy goal and one that the National Park Service should be commended for implementing.\nGeorge Wuerthner is an author who has written about California's wild places, among them California's coast, Yosemite and the Sierra Nevada.

The lack of rain and wind prompted the Bay Area Air Quality Management District to declare \"no burn\" days to help stem air pollution, especially unhealthy particulate matter created by wood fires. \nMany Bay Area residents who had to keep their hearths fire-free grumbled that \"no burn\" days are a product of an over-zealous environmental agency. This winter, we're on track to set a record for the number of Spare the Air days, which has fueled the grumbling, particularly over the holidays.\nThe grumbling also is a product of the air quality agency's problems informing the public about the need for no-burn days and explaining, clearly, the climatic factors that lead the agency to ban fires   even fining those who violate the edict.\nMarin is fortunate that prevailing winds usually blow homegrown pollution out of the county. That doesn't mean that it is Sonoma County's problem, or Sacramento's.\nSpare the Air days are called to not only protect air quality close to home, but where bay and ocean breezes blow the dirty air we generate.\nMarin residents care about the environment and air pollution.\nIn 2010, 78.2 percent of Marin's voters rejected Proposition 23, which sought to repeal clean air objectives of the state anti-global warming initiative. The proposition was defeated with 61.6 percent of the voters statewide refusing to endorse it.\nSpare the Air days are part of a years-long effort to combat air pollution. Smog control and testing for cars and pollution-control rules for smokestack businesses led the way in initiatives that several years ago were expanded to include home fires.\nBesides environmental benefits, these clean-air initiatives benefit people with breathing problems, such as asthma, that are worsened by a layer of wood smoke.\nNo-burn days may mean the fireplace has to remain idle, we have to wear sweaters around the house, add a blanket or two or turn up the heater thermostat, which has its own environmental and financial costs. But it means others can breathe a lot easier.\nFor many, that's more critical than the warmth from a crackling fire in a home's hearth.\nWhile the air quality agency has done a good job of giving public notice of \"no burn\" days, given this likely record-beating season, it would be valuable to do a lot more outreach and clearly explain the climatic reasons for declaring Spare the Air days and specific air-quality benefits that are being achieved.\nThe objective of keeping our skies clear, blue and clean should be universally accepted, but how we try to achieve it is still being debated.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Smoke rises from a chimney in this 2011 photo of a Marin County home.

Marin Sanitary Service, the San Rafael-based curbside pickup company serving much of the county, sends the trees to Marin Resource Recovery, in San Rafael. The trees are put through a grinder to make mulch   a chipped salad of green needles and wood bits.\nThe mulch is then loaded onto trucks and shipped 80 miles to the northeast.\n\"We process them, grind them up with other wood we collect, and then we send it up to Woodland Biomass,\" said Nick Minton, Resource Recovery's facility manager. \"They use it to make electricity.\"\nWoodland Biomass Power, an alternative-fuel power plant about 20 miles outside of Sacramento, uses the mulch to fuel a boiler that produces steam, which generates electricity to power.\nSouthern Marin trees have a different fate. Mill Valley Refuse Service collects the trees and sends them to Redwood Landfill in Novato, where they are turned into organic compost.\n\"It's good for any kind of backyard gardening,\" said Redwood district manager Dan North. \"But most of our compost is used for agriculture.\"\nNorth said most of Redwood's compost is distributed throughout Marin, Napa and Sonoma counties, to wine growers and other local agriculture producers, who regularly get compost from Redwood.\nThe Christmas trees \"are composted like any other feedstock we get,\" North said.\nFor most of the year, Mill Valley Refuse runs six trucks a day, to pick up garbage, recycling and compostable waste. During the several weeks following Christmas, the refuse company sends out eight trucks.\n\"The regular route guys will pick up trees, but they get overloaded,\" Iavarone said. \"So we have other trucks out there picking up the overload. Also, up on Mt. Tam, we have some very narrow streets, so we have some pickup trucks go get those trees.\"\nMost Christmas trees are left on curbs within the first couple weeks of January, but the refuse companies get a few stragglers ever year.\n\"We expect to get the vast majority of them by the end of the month, but we actually have some people who will pull one out in June,\" Iavarone said. \"As long as it's a Christmas tree, we'll take it on (the customers') green-can days.\"\nLocal refuse and waste management brass said it's difficult to get a count on how many trees they pick up, since many of the trees are co-mingled with other trees and yard waste.\nMinton said Resource Recovery handles 15,000 to 20,000 trees. Mill Valley Refuse has 12,000 residential customers; officials were uncertain how many trees the agency picks up.\nWhile Woodland Biomass, which produces electricity for PG&E, receives tens of thousands of Christmas trees every January, the extra fuel translates to little more than a blip on the production radar.\n\"We typically burn about 800 tons of waste wood on a daily basis,\" said Mike Fillmore, Woodland Biomass's operations manager. \"I'm not discounting the Christmas trees ... but it would be difficult to give them any kind of percentage.\"\nContact Laith Agha via email atlagha@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Workers at the Marin Resource Recovery process discarded Christmas trees for recycling on Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2014 in San Rafael, Calif.

But after a rough 0-2 start, the Trojans certainly needed some kind of spark.\nBehind Beau Keeve's 36-point outburst, the Trojans pumped new life into their MCAL season by upending visiting and previously unbeaten in league Novato 76-70 in a thrilling overtime victory.\n\"Now we're back in it,\" Terra Linda coach Steve Farbstein said. \"It could've been disaster if we didn't win this game.\" \nThe Trojans (7-7, 1-2) averted the dreaded 0-3 start by outscoring the Hornets (11-4, 2-1) 12-6 in the four-minute overtime period.\nKirby Dederian provided a big lift for Terra Linda in the extra period. After going scoreless for four quarters, Dederian knocked down a 3-pointer and two clutch free throws in overtime.\n\"Kirby is kind of our fifth-wheel on the offensive end,\" Farbstein said. \"There's other guys who we look to for scoring. But he can knock down a shot when he needs to.\"\nAfter Novato's Josh Broughton   25 points and three assists   scored on an offensive rebound and follow shot to kick off overtime, TL's Keeve sank the front end of a one-and-one free throw, Josh Pinto grabbed the offensive rebound and and Dederian buried the 3-pointer. The Trojans never trailed again.\nIn fact, the Trojans led for most of the contest. Novato took its first lead since the opening 10 seconds of the game at 3:42 of the third period when Andy Velasquez, who had a team-high 27 points, scored inside off a crisp pass from McCoy Wegner.\nThe Hornets played their best in the third when they outscored the Trojans 18-12, but it was the only one of the five periods they posted an edge.\n\"In crunch time, they did a better job than we did,\" Novato coach Andrew Strawbridge said. \"We didn't play very good defense tonight except in the third period. I wish we would've played third quarter defense all game.\"\nBefore the game started, Farbstein worried about his team's ability to rebound with the taller Hornets.\n\"They're a little bigger than us and rebounding has been an issue with us all season,\" Farbstein said.\nOnce the game started, however, forward Josh Pinto did his best to put his coach at ease as he hauled down a game-high 11 rebounds, including eight in the first half when the Trojans built a 36-29 lead.\nNovato's third period comeback was fueled by a technical foul on TL center Zach Able   19 points   who slammed the ball hard into the floor in frustration after his team was called for an offensive foul.\nThe Hornets led by as many as seven points in the third period, but the Trojans finished strong as Keeve scored eight points in the final three minutes of the quarter.\nThe game was nip-and-tuck the rest of the way. Novato led by four with a little more than two minutes remaining until Able canned a pull-up jumper and Keeve drove the lane for a layup to knot the score at 64-64.\nNeither team scored in the final 1:27 of regulation time.\nContact Tim Menicutch via email atsports@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Kirby Dederian of Terra Linda eyes the basket on a fast break during the Trojans' game against Novato in San Rafael, Calif. on Thursday, Jan. 9, 2014.

The Marin Community Alliance, a new group that wants the court to reject the county's plan to meet state housing quotas, filed suit late last year, claiming officials failed to review environmental concerns.\nThe Board of Supervisors, in approving a density program that reaffirms existing development potential, essentially embraced general plan policies in place for years that focus development in the county's \"city-centered corridor\" while preserving rural tracts.\nThe county board's unanimous vote of approval last fall was hailed by housing advocates but condemned by neighborhood activists in Tamalpais Valley, Strawberry and Marinwood.\n\"Recall them all!\" yelled Stephen Nestel at the time. Nestel, founder ofsavemarinwood.org , saying a new video along with housing commentary will be posted on his website, called the county's plan \"an outrageous assault on our communities\" and said the state has endorsed \"an imperial act by an out-of-touch Board of Supervisors.\"\nMost top county officials did not respond to requests for comment beyond a press release that referred questions to principal planner Leelee Thomas. Supervisor Steve Kinsey said he was \"relieved\" at the state action, saying it \"came just in time to protect millions in transportation funds,\" but added \"there remains an important community conversation\" before a housing policy review takes place next year.\nAs it stands, an affordable housing \"overlay\" zone for up to 30 units per acre covers two acres of the Golden Gate Baptist Seminary in Strawberry, a half-acre at Oak Hill School in Marin City, and the 3.5 acres at the St. Vincent's-Silveira tract. It does not increase development potential but focuses on \"clustering\" buildings.\nAlthough not in the overlay zone, policies allow affordable housing elsewhere as well, including the old Chevron station at Tam Junction; Marinwood Plaza, and Grady Ranch. The policies outline potential building sites in unincorporated areas, where the goal is 443 more homes by the end of this year on top of the 330 units planned for since 2007. Overall, 489 of the 773 dwellings in the planning period were designated to accommodate moderate and low income residents.\nState approval of the county program came at the same time it endorsed Novato's housing program. Unlike the county, which approved a 30-unit affordable housing density, Novato officials negotiated densities of from 20 to 23 units an acre.\n\"We took the time to ensure a housing program that reflects the needs and character of our city, and densities more appropriate for Novato,\" said Councilwoman Denise Athas in a statement announcing state approval of city plans.\nSupervisor Judy Arnold noted the state rejected the county's initial submittal of a housing plan that included densities lower than 30 units per acre, and \"in turning in our revised housing element we stayed with 30 units per acre because we had land already zoned for that.\"\nAs for the deal carved out by city officials, \"I believe the acceptance of 23 units per acre that was approved for Novato reflects a change in attitude ... that the county will take advantage of as we move forward with our next housing element,\" Arnold said.\nNels Johnson via email at twitter.com/nelsjohnsonnews", "author": "By Nels Johnson", "title": "State applauds Marin housing plan"}, {"relevance": [149.5], "text": "Friday's local events\nHIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nNorth Bay vs. Voice of Pentecost           3 p.m.           San Rafael\nHIGH SCHOOL BOYS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nNorth Bay vs. Voice of Pentecost           5:30 p.m.           San Rafael\nSaturday's local events \nCOLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nCOM at Merritt           7:30 p.m.           Oakland\nCOLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nCOM at Merritt           5:30 p.m.           Oakland\nHIGH SCHOOL BOYS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nBay Area: MA at Bay           11 a.m.           San Francisco\nBranson at Novato           7:30 p.m.           Novato\nJustin-Siena at Marin Catholic           7:30 p.m.           Kentfield\nRedwood at San Marin           7:30 p.m.           San Marin\nTerra Linda at San Rafael           7:30 p.m.           San Rafael\nDrake at Tam           7:30 p.m.           Mill Valley\nHIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nBay Area: San Domenico vs. Urban           3:30 p.m.           International Bay Area: MA vs. Bay           3:30 p.m.           San Francisco\nRedwood at San Marin           6 p.m.           San Marin\nBranson at Novato           6 p.m.           Novato\nJustin-Siena at Marin Catholic           6 p.m.           Kentfield\nDrake at Tam           6 p.m.           Mill Valley\nTerra Linda at San Rafael           6 p.m.           San Rafael\nHIGH SCHOOL WRESTLING           Time           Place\nRedwood at Clayton Valley Invitational           TBA           Concord San Rafael at TBD tourney           TBD           TBD\nON THE AIR friDAY\nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL           Time           TV           Radio\nRadford at High Point           4 p.m.           ESPNU\nWomen: Stanford at Utah           5 p.m.           P12BA\nWright State at Valparaiso           6 p.m.           ESPNU\nWomen: Cal at Colorado           7 p.m.           P12BA\nWomen: USC at Arizona St.           2 a.m. (Sat.)

He was 67.\nMr. St\u00b8cky lived in San Rafael and Mill Valley from 1983 to 2006, working as a householder priest, designer and landscaper. He was the guiding teacher of the Dharma Eye Zen Center in San Rafael until his death and served as co-leader of the Buddhadharma Sangha meditation group at San Quentin State Prison for many years.\nSusan O'Connell, president of the San Francisco Zen Center, said Mr. St\u00b8cky was a thoughtful man who faced death gracefully, dealing with it directly. She said he had a huge impact on those who knew him. \n\"His commitment was to basically help people all his life and to understand the nature of what it means to be a human being,\" O'Connell said. \"Before he died, he encouraged me to continue to make the difficult decisions that need to be made and not turn away from the pain of those decisions.\"\nMr. St\u00b8cky was born March 6, 1946 in Chicago and grew up in Newton, Kansas with his family of Mennonite farmers. In 1972 he hitchhiked to San Francisco, where he studied Zen at the San Francisco Zen Center for eight years. He studied pastoral counseling at the San Francisco Theological Seminary in San Anselmo and received advanced training in internal family systems psychotherapy.\nIn 2007 Mr. St\u00b8cky became co-abbot of the San Francisco Zen Center, taking up residence at the center's Green Gulch Farm in Muir Beach and teaching others how to farm. He became to first to fill the role of central abbot in 2010 as part of the center's restructuring. He stayed in that role until stepping down last year.\nMr. St\u00b8cky was known as one of the \"fire monks\" who defended the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center in Carmel Valley from the flames of the Basin Complex Fire in Central California in 2008 after firefighters evacuated the area. Author Colleen Busch wrote about Mr. St\u00b8cky's experience in her book \"Fire Monks: Zen Mind Meets Wildfire.\"\nBusch said Mr. St\u00b8cky was a humble and down-to-earth man who trusted his instincts.\n\"He was really independently minded, strong-willed and determined, but he was also incredibly aware of his actions and effect on others,\" Busch said.\nDavid Zimmerman, program director at the San Francisco Zen Center, was one of the fire monks who worked alongside Mr. St\u00b8cky. He said having spiritual leadership present to meet the fire was hugely supportive.\n\"It's not too often you end up going through a difficult life-threatening situation with a teacher,\" Zimmerman said. \"That was quite meaningful and powerful.\"\nBusch, who studied Zen with Mr. St\u00b8cky, said his death has had a huge impact on the community and he will be remembered fondly.\n\"It's heartbreaking for people, but his talks are recorded and saved, so I feel like he's still teaching,\" Busch said.\nAfter being diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer in September, Mr. St\u00b8cky began writing a blog about his personal process of dealing with a terminal illness, which can be viewed online atsubtleeye.sfzc.org .\nHe is survived by his wife Lane Olson, son James Asher, daughter Hannah Dominguez, daughter Robin Williams and four grandchildren.\nA funeral ceremony will be held at 3 p.m. Feb. 9, at Green Dragon Temple at the Green Gulch Farm Zen Center, 1601 Shoreline Highway in Muir Beach.

Jared Huffman, D-San Rafael, and others to fully restore funding to the parks as the federal budget is negotiated. \n\"Congressman Huffman and the Bay Area congressional delegation need to fight for full funding for our national parks in the budget negotiations,\" said Nathan Weaver, preservation advocate for Environment California, speaking at Crissy Field in San Francisco.\nWhile the budget deal passed in December may allow for some increase in the parks budget, it is up to congressional spending committees to decide the actual funding levels this month, Weaver said.\nHuffman said he is working to provide full funding to the parks and is behind such efforts \"100 percent.\"\n\"It is certainly something we have lobbied for,\" Huffman said Thursday. \"This is definitely one of the priorities.\"\nEnvironment California   a nonprofit   issued its report, \"Death by a Thousand Cuts,\" outlining the challenges facing California's national parks as a result of funding cuts.\n\"At Golden Gate National Recreation Area, budget cuts have forced the superintendent to close visitor centers several days a week, reduce trash collection, and delay repairs on buildings, roads and trails,\" said Nathan Weaver, Preservation Advocate with Environment California. \"We don't want a death by a thousand cuts for Golden Gate National Recreation Area or California's national parks.\"\nThe report shows the GGNRA has lost $873,000 over the past three years between budget reductions and the March 2013 sequestration.\n\"Cuts have forced the Point Reyes National Seashore to close a visitor center, to close the iconic Point Reyes Lighthouse an additional day a week, and to reduce the number of lighthouse educational programs from 16 to six over the summer,\" Weaver said.\nPoint Reyes has lost $374,000 in funding over the period, according to the report. The Muir Woods National Monument lost $22,000. Statewide, national parks lost $8 million in funding, a 13 percent reduction in funding over the period.\nThe report also noted the economic importance of national parks. A separate 2012 report calculated that visitors to federal parklands provided more than $400 million to Marin communities. Together, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Point Reyes National Seashore and Muir Woods accounted for nearly one-third of the overall $1.3 billion visitors spent in association with national parks in California, according to the peer-reviewed analysis conducted by Michigan State University for the National Park Service.\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Nathan Weaver of Environment California addresses budget impacts to Marin's national parks during a press conference at San Francisco's Crissy Field on Thursday, Jan. 9, 2014.

In 2012, the CHP arrested 60 DUI suspects under the age of 21. In 2011, the number was also 60.\nThe data only apply to the state highways and unincorporated roads patrolled by the CHP, said Officer Andrew Barclay. The statistics include 11 arrests in the last three months of 2013, including three incidents involving a crash.\nIn the Novato Police Department's jurisdiction, police arrested 11 DUI suspects under the age of 21 last year, according to Chief James Berg.

But Jesse Jacobs, the owner of San Francisco's three Samovar Tea Lounges is surprisingly enthusiastic about it.\n\"It's a recognition that tea is the next big thing,\" says Jacobs, who opened his first tea lounge 13 years ago. \"I see it as a good thing. It validates the growing market for tea.\"\nAnd tea is trending with a capital T. \nA quick scan of the aisles at the grocery store provides further proof, with a mind boggling array of teas encroaching on coffee's territory, including two Bay Area produced brands: Novato's Republic of Tea and Numi Organic Teas out of Oakland.\nAccording to the Tea Association of the USA, the wholesale tea industry has grown from an estimated $2 billion dollars in 1990 to an estimated $10 billion in 2013, and that number is expected to almost double over the next few years.\nSpeaking rapidly, partly because of his passion for the subject and perhaps because he'd just spent the morning sampling 30 varieties of tea from Nepal, Jacobs indicated the increasing demand for tea is due in part to mounting evidence of its health benefits as well as growing interest in quality artisan foods and beverages.\nBut tea, with all its varieties   from green to black to oolong to the somewhat funky, fermented pu-erh   can be intimidating.\nChristopher Coccagna is a San Francisco tea sommelier and owner of T-We Teas, where he crafts his own tea blends. Like Jacobs, Coccagna helps customers navigate the complexities of tea, teaching them how to taste, brew and even pair teas with food.\nEven without access to a tea expert, there are plenty of resources for those interested in learning more about tea and food pairings. Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page, authors of \"What to Drink with What You Eat\" (Bulfinch, 2006), say those who enjoy wine are likely to also enjoy tea. Pairing it with food follows similar guidelines: Lighter, green teas pair best with things like seafood and chicken, while stronger black teas go well with beef and spicy dishes.\nTea mixology\nThe growing taste for tea isn't limited to just what's sold in cups, either. Trend forecasts show it's spilling over onto dinner plates, and into desserts and cocktails in particular. Andrew Freeman & Co., a San Francisco-based restaurant and hospitality consulting company, predicts that \"tea-tails\" will show up on more beverage menus as mixologists turn to tea and tea-based liqueurs to expand their repertoire.\nFrom the Earl Grey-infused gin used in a Marteani at Martin's West in Redwood City to the Lady Marmalade, a blend of Qi white tea liqueur, brandy and citrus at the Village Pub in Woodside, tea is already proving to be a tasty addition to a tipple.\nTea cocktails can be as simple as brewing a pot of tea at home.\nCoccagna created several winter cocktails using tea and milk for the Got Milk campaign because of the two ingredients' natural affinity. His favorite is the White Russian Caravan, a concoction of smoky Russian Caravan tea, vodka and coffee liqueur, with a milk float.\nMaster mixologist Jim Meehan has a recipe for a party-perfect green tea and rum punch that's little more than brewed tea, rum and lime juice.\nOn the plate\nChefs use tea leaves and brewed tea, not just because it's trendy, but also because the tannins in tea complement the fats in things like meat and dairy, while adding subtle flavor.\nTea has long been used in dishes like the classic Sichuan tea-smoked duck and tea-leaf salad, a popular offering at Burmese restaurants in the Bay Area. At Samovar, Jacobs uses tea in rubs for fish and poultry, as well as the basis for a brothy, Japanese-style soup.\nTasting menus at the Michelin-starred Baume in Menlo Park and Manresa in Los Gatos have recently featured tea. Manresa's David Kinch serves squab with prunes in black tea, and his much-heralded first cookbook, released last year, features a few recipes using tea, including smoked salmon roe in a black tea and bonito jelly.\nCreamy and chocolaty desserts are a common vehicle for tea as well. Green tea ice cream is almost standard at Japanese restaurants, and green tea macarons are popular at Chantal Guillon shops in San Francisco and Palo Alto.\nBergamot-laced Earl Grey tea also makes regular dessert menu appearances, popping up in panna cotta at San Francisco's Fifth Floor and in the cr\u00cbme Anglaise served with the chocolate souffle at the Village Pub. And former Novato resident Yigit Pura uses organic Earl Grey to flavor a dark chocolate macaron named in honor of \"Star Trek\" Capt. Jean Luc Picard in his Macy's Union Square patisserie, Tout Sweet.\nBut for devotees like Jacobs and Coccagna, tea is more than an ingredient in a dish or even a drink. It's a lifestyle.\n\"In an era dominated by distraction and cellphones, tea helps us connect with our humanity,\" says Jacobs, whose menu invites people to turn off their gadgets and spend time communicating face to face over a cup of tea.\nCoccagna echoes that, saying tea is about community and collaboration.\n\"Typically you share tea with someone,\" he says. \"There's beauty in that exchange.\"\nRECIPES\nGreen tea rum punch\nMakes 10 servings\nNote: Use the package instructions to brew the Sencha and Moroccan mint teas.\n1\u03a9 cups brewed Sencha tea\n1\u03a9 cups brewed Moroccan mint tea\n1 cup raw demerara sugar\n1\u00ba cups freshly squeezed lime juice\n750 ml blended English-style rum, such as Banks \"5 Island\" Blended Rum\nFreshly grated nutmeg to garnish\nBrew the Sencha and Moroccan mint teas in  3 cups of boiling water  using package instructions. Add the raw sugar to the hot tea  and stir until the sugar dissolves. Steep the tea for a few minutes. Remove the tea bags/leaves and discard.\nPour the tea into a large pitcher; add a quart of crushed ice to cool it.

This twist on a traditional recipe applies a \"tea stock\" in a new way to create a rich, complex dish.\n4 cups vegetable or chicken stock\n3 tablespoons Indian Assam black tea\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n2 cloves garlic, crushed\n1 leek, white part only, thinly sliced\n2 cups Arborio rice\n\u00ba cup fresh Italian parsley, chopped\nGrated Parmesan cheese, optional\nSalt, pepper to taste\nMushrooms:\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 tablespoon butter\n1 cup chanterelle mushrooms, cut in long strips\nDash balsamic vinegar\nIn a saucepan over medium heat, bring the stock to a boil. Place the Assam tea in a large tea or herb ball and drop it into the stock. Reduce heat to low; let steep 5 minutes. Stock will brew into a rich brown mixture with red tones.\nIn another large saucepan over medium heat, warm the 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add garlic and leek; saute until translucent, but do not brown. Add rice and stir until partially translucent.\nLadle hot tea stock, \u03a9 cup at a time, into the rice mixture, stirring until the liquid is almost completely absorbed before adding more. Repeat, stirring, until all the liquid is absorbed and the risotto reaches a firm, but chewy consistency.\nMeanwhile, heat the oil and butter for the mushrooms in a saute pan. Add the chanterelles and a dash of balsamic vinegar; saute until the liquid is absorbed, about 4 minutes.\nGently stir the parsley into the risotto. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve the risotto with mushrooms on top, garnished with Parmesan cheese.\n  Christopher Coccagna, tea sommelier\nWhite Russian Caravan\nMakes 4 servings\n1 cup water\n2 tablespoons Russian Caravan black tea\n4 ounces vodka\n2 ounces coffee liqueur\n1 cup whole milk\nBring water to a boil.

This would cause a loss of jobs, especially in the construction industry.\nThe real answer is to increase the supply of water and let the users pay the cost.\nTechnological advances, both here and around the world, are also a critical part of the answer.\nMMWD has had four decades to solve the supply part of the problem and it is obvious that the directors and senior management have failed to produce a short- and long-term answer.\nManagement will blame the weather; however, the weather is what it is and management should have anticipated that this record drought would eventually arrive.\nPerhaps MMWD directors will perform a traditional rain dance in the hope of appeasing the rain gods.\nIf they want to blame someone or something, they should look in the mirror.\nLuke Mazur, Belvedere\nExpand the reservoirs\nThere will never be enough water in Marin unless we increase our reservoir capactiy.\nThere's no need for consultants, simply dig and deepen the existing lakes.\nAlan Larkins, San Rafael\nA real Marin 'blizzard'\nThe members of the Marin Board of Supervisors spent a fair amount of time at their meeting Tuesday defending their belief that high-density development is OK and belongs along the Highway 101 corridor.\nSupervisor Katie Rice had to add the caveat, as she led the charge, by making sure we all knew that the county board had absolutely nothing to do with the massive high-density housing development at Corte Madera's old WinCup site.\nHowever, she didn't hesitate to state that the project is not out of context with the rest of the development along Highway 101 and that we all needed to \"put it in perspective.\"\nShe closed her long-winded speech with a request for all of us to be honest without pointing fingers and stating that the supervisors have been listening very hard to their constituents.\nSupervisor Steve Kinsey piled on, saying that Marin County has had the longest standing vision, going back 40 years, of preserving our coast and agricultural lands and that there seems to be a \"blizzard of fear and concern   no rain   but a blizzard of fear\" surrounding development along 101.\nSupervisor Judy Arnold made a leap, intimating that if we don't accept development along the 101 corridor that somehow our open space and West Marin land will be threatened.\nI will tell you what blizzard is brewing: It is the people who are tired of the blatant disregard by our elected officials for what most of the residents in Marin want.\nWe want to keep Marin suburban, not urban.\nHundreds of us spent hours attending all the Planning Commission and board hearings on the housing element in 2013 but no one listened.\nUnless \"we the people\" stand up and do something now, the 101 corridor will be lined with more high-density housing like the WinCup development.\nCarol Brandt, San RafaeL", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 16"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "ON JAN. 19 AND 21, the Marin Symphony honors Martin Luther King, performing composer Joseph Schwantner's \"New Morning for World,\" an homage to the late civil rights leader built around his selected oratory. I am privileged to narrate.\nIn reading historian Taylor Branch's exhaustive three-volume trilogy, beginning with \"Parting the Waters,\" America during the King years, one is struck by how far we've come while at the same time acknowledging how far we've yet to go. \nAmerica before King was a much different place. One needn't go any further than the twice-elected President Barack Obama to prove it.\nIn the 1980s, on a program with Ed Asner, TV's Lou Grant quipped what was then axiomatic humor. \"A Jewish person, a woman and a black person all had an audience with God. The Jewish person asked: 'Will there ever be a Jewish president. The Lord answered: 'Yes, there will be a Jewish president, but not in your lifetime.' The woman asked similarly: 'Lord will there ever be a female president?' The Lord spoke: 'Yes my daughter that too will come to pass. But not in your lifetime.' The Brother asked: Lord, will there be a black president? Yes my son, the creator answered balefully ... but not in My lifetime.'\"\nYesterday's impossibility is today's miracle and tomorrow's fact.\nThe 1954 the Brown decision no doubt empowered King to infuse black people with what his mentor Howard Thurman called, \"a strange new valor.\" Borrowing a description of Winston Churchill, Martin Luther King, from the pulpit of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, \"mobilized the English language and sent it into battle\" against the entrenched forces of American apartheid.\nHe became the spiritual field general of the Montgomery bus boycott, preaching non-violent transformation, symbolized by the courage of Rosa Parks. On to Birmingham, Atlanta, Chicago and beyond, his soaring oratory and searing truth prodded the aroused conscience of America, prompting President Lyndon Johnson to push through the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the '65 Voting Rights Act and the 1968 Fair Housing legislation.\nThe question is always asked of the great, were they alive today how would they view our present world.\nWe get a hint of that when King writes: \"I submit to you that any individual who decides to break a law that conscience tells him is unjust and is willing to accept the penalty for it is at that moment expressing the very highest respect for the law. There is nothing new about this. Go back with me if you will to the Old Testament. See Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego as they stand before King Nebuchadnezzar. They made it clear: 'We cannot come.' Come if you will to Plato's Dialogues. Open the Credo or the Apology. See Socrates practicing civil disobedience. Academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience. Come to the early Christians. See them practicing civil disobedience to the point they were willing to be thrown to the lions to stand up for what they believed. Listen to Peter as he says, 'We must obey God rather than man.'\n\"Come to the modern world. Never forget that everything Hitler did was legal. It was illegal to comfort and aid a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And I believe if I had lived there ... I would have disobeyed that law.\n\"If I lived in South Africa today I would join with Chief Luthuli as he says to his people, 'Break this law. Don't take this unjust pass system ... tear them up.'\"\nAmerica, South Africa and the world has benefitted from the lasting legacy of Martin Luther King.\nNoah Griffin of Tiburon is a public affairs consultant and a former community member of the IJ's editorial board.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Noah Griffin of Tiburon. .\nNoah Griffin", "author": "By Noah Griffin Guest op-ed column", "title": "Marin Voice: Celebrating Martin Luther King's vision"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Tim Lee did his time at grad school, putting his parents' money to use at the University of California at Davis.

Police found a duffel bag containing nine cellphones inside the vehicle and took the property into evidence.\nRoberts was apparently released on bail. Police later determined that at least one of the cellphones had been stolen by a window-smashing burglar at Cambio Plus International, a cellphone and money order business on Bellam Boulevard in San Rafael.\nThen, on Jan. 8, a man stole four Infinitis and a Mercedes from the Infiniti dealership in Kirkland. Police Lt. Mike Murray said the burglar accessed the dealership through a back door and stole car keys from a counter, then found the matching cars in the sales lot.\nHe drove off in the cars one by one and parked them in a lot nearby, Murray said.\nLate the next night, the man returned in the stolen Mercedes but triggered a burglary alarm. That set off a police chase that ended when the suspect crashed into a retaining wall and escaped in a slough.\n\"Even though it was freezing, he swam a pretty good distance and got away from us that night,\" Murray said. \"He just crashed that car and bounded right away. He's a slippery one.\"\nOn Tuesday, police received a report that Roberts had been seen at Ritter Center in downtown San Rafael. When Roberts returned on Wednesday morning, someone at the center called the police department.\nAs police converged on the area, Roberts bolted toward Fourth Street and then turned back south, darting toward the city parking garage at Third Street and Lootens Place, police said.\nWitnesses Tracey Milne and J.R. Roloff said the suspect displayed considerable agility in evading a group of gun-wielding officers.\n\"He was like a springbok,\" said Milne, a native of South Africa.\nRoberts was arrested after jumping from the second story of the parking garage, bouncing off the awning of a business and crashing to the pavement, Rohrbacher said. San Rafael firefighters took Roberts to Marin General Hospital for treatment of minor injuries.\nRoberts was released from the hospital Wednesday and booked into Marin County Jail. His bail was initially set at $200,000.\nRoberts' criminal history in Marin includes convictions for resisting arrest, possession of stolen property and driving without a license, according to court records.\nIn February 2011, he was arrested after an alleged crime rampage in downtown San Rafael. Police said he tried to rob a man at a cash machine, threatened customers with a fork at a downtown restaurant and kicked a police officer in the head.\nContact Gary Klien via email atgklien@marinij.com orhttps://twitter.com/GaryKlien", "author": "By Gary Klien", "title": "San Rafael police arrest fugitive suspect after plunge from parking garage"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "In response to an ongoing drought, beginning Thursday the Marin Municipal Water District will start pumping water out of Phoenix Lake, a reserve reservoir.\nOver the next 30 days the district will pump water from the reservoir to the district's Bon Tempe treatment plant on the Mount Tamalpais watershed and then into the water distribution system that serves customers in central and southern Marin.\nThe move will drop the water level in Phoenix Lake by 20 feet if there is no rain over the period. \n\"It will be a very visual reminder of what is going on,\" said Libby Pischel, district spokeswoman.\nThe district doesn't like to use the lake because of the cost to pump millions of gallons of water 600 feet uphill to the Bon Tempe reservoir, but it has little choice given the dearth of rain.\n\"Our system flows downhill, but this will require us to pump uphill,\" said Mike Ban, engineering manager for the water district.\nHe added the district wants to use the Phoenix Lake supply now before it begins to evaporate. In all some 200 acre feet will be pumped from the reservoir over the next month. An acre foot can supply about three single-family homes with water for a year. There are 325,851 gallons in an acre foot.\nThe district is also in the process of preparing the Soulajule Reservoir   another reserve water supply   for activation this spring if the rains do not come.\nPhoenix Lake was last tapped for 11 days in March 2012, but then the rains came as part of a \"Miracle March\" deluge. Before that, Phoenix and Soulajule were used during a drought between 1987 and 1992.\nThe current drought led to Marin recording a record-low 10.68 inches of rain in 2013 at Lake Lagunitas, where the water district   which has data dating to 1879   keeps its official weather gauge. The previous record low in Marin was set in 1929 when 19.06 inches of rain fell. The annual average is 52 inches per year.\nThe previous record low was set in 1929 when 19.06 inches of rain fell. The annual average is 52 inches per year. Even 1976   the first year of the major 1976-77 drought   saw more rain with 21.34 inches.\nUnlike some districts that receive water from melt off from a potent Sierra snowpack, Marin is at the mercy of real-time rain, which provides much of the drinking water for the county via eight reservoirs, most on Mount Tamalpais and one at Stafford Lake in Novato. The rest comes from the Russian River, which also is fed by local rains.\nWater managers are taking notice of the drought. Last month the Marin Municipal Water District Board of Directors passed a resolution acknowledging the extreme dry weather conditions. The district is asking the public to watch water use.\nIt is also maximizing the use of Nicasio Reservoir, which fills faster than the other six reservoirs when it does rain; canceled an annual flushing of its water distribution system and is preparing an early start for its recycled water plant used for irrigation, among other steps.\nOn average, Mount Tam reservoirs at this time of year are at 77 percent of capacity, but now stand at 55 percent. Rationing won't be formally addressed until April 1 per Marin Municipal board policy. At that point if there are 50,000 or fewer acre feet in the system, a 10 percent voluntary rationing program would kick in. If there is less than 40,000 acre feet, a 25 percent mandatory program would be implemented. As of this week there were 43,943 acre feet in the reservoirs.\n\"This is unprecedented, 2013 was our driest year on record,\" said Krishna Kumar, general manager of the district. \"We are taking the appropriate steps, but we are getting into some uncharted territory.\"\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com", "author": "By Mark Prado", "title": "Water district to start using Phoenix Lake for water supply as rains stay away"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "By Tim Menicutch\nAt 6-foot-5, Brandon Kenilvort was pretty much used to having his way when he roamed the paint for the Drake High basketball team.\nKenilvort, starting freshman forward for College of Marin, learned in a hurry the glory days of high school are meaningless at the next level.\nHe remembers back in summer when the COM men's team got together for its first shoot around. \n\"We were playing five-on-five for the first time in front of the whole team,\" Kenilvort said. \"So I get this fastbreak layup and I just completely missed a slam dunk. I'm there trying to prove a point about how tough I was and all the other guys are probably thinking, 'Look at that sorry white boy from Marin.'\"\nThe humbling experience was just the tip of the iceberg for Kenilvort in his realization of how difficult the transition to college basketball really is.\n\"Early on in the season, Brandon and I had a long conversation in my office,\" said COM coach Dave Granucci, who has a young Mariners team (9-7, 3-2 Bay Valley Conference) off to a fast start in conference play. \"Instead of telling me what I wanted to hear, he was open and honest and he told me he wasn't where he wanted to be. From that point on, he's been a better player. I think he now understands what it takes to play at the college level.\"\nKenilvort, a resident of San Anselmo, says his biggest problem was the adjustment to the speed of the college game.\n\"I heard it 100 times. Everybody told me, even coach Granucci and (Drake) coach (Doug) Donnellan, about how the speed of the game was a lot faster,\" Kenilvort said. \"But still, it was really an eye-opening experience on how quick everything moves.\"\nOn top of adjusting to the accelerated pace, Kenilvort said he had another stark realization. He was no longer the big kid on the court. In fact, at times he felt slight in comparison to some of his opponents.\n\"In college, there are a lot of big strong kids that make me look like I should be playing in the perimeter or something,\" he said.\nEven as he struggled with the transition, Kenilvort kept reminding himself of one important fact.\n\"If I wasn't good enough to play at this level, I wouldn't be here playing,\" he said. \"I have to tell myself every time I go on the court that I know I have the ability to play at this level.\"\nSo, there he was in a big new world. Since he was no longer bigger or faster or stronger than his opponents, he had no choice but to refine, and more importantly, redefine his role on the court.\nHe worked meticulously in practice on positioning and thinking one step ahead on defense. Holding no physical advantages, he was forced to find an edge on the cerebral side, most notably with pure intensity and focus.\n\"Coach Granucci has this motto that we can't take one play off, not one second to try to catch your breath,\" Kenilvort said. \"If you do, you're a sitting duck out there. It's happened to me on defense where I'm just standing up on defense and somebody blows right by me. On defense, you have to go 100 percent all the time.\"\nGranucci said this season most of his freshman-dominated team has experienced the same sort of shock as Kenilvort. The coach said there's only one way over the hurdle.\n\"You have to get out and play and see the speed of game,\" Granucci said. \"The athletes have to figure out it's a thinking man's game, that they really have to think it out and make smart plays.\"\nKenilvort is figuring it out.\n\"If I can't jump as high, I have to box out harder,\" he said. \"If I'm not as quick, then it's all about positioning and being one step ahead.\"\nOne of nine freshmen on COM's surprising BVC-contending team, Kenilvort understands his role and is comfortable with it.\n\"I know my role,\" he said. \"We have some guys who can score better than I could ever dream of scoring. I try to clean up around the rim, and yeah, defense is a huge part of our team. That's what I focus on in games. I take pride in my defense. I know everybody else can score. I never worry about getting my shots up, but instead worry about defensive stops, blocking shots and pulling down rebounds. Those kinds of things make my game for me.\"\nGranucci says Kenilvort has come a long way already this season. And he quickly adds, his freshman forward is only scratching the surface of how good a college player he can become.\n\"He's still learning the game,\" Granucci said. \"He's going to improve tremendously as the year goes on and we're going to see a big jump in his play when he's sophomore. He had a play the other day off a rebound. He dribbles once and goes up with two guys hanging on him. There's no foul and he misses the shot. A year from now he goes through that contact, explodes and finishes the play.\"\nContact Tim Menicutch via email atsports@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: College of Marin basketball player Brandon Kenilvort poses for a photo in Kentfield, Calif. on Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2014.

He resigned under a cloud of controversy. Conservatives raised concerns about some matters in Jones' past, including derogatory remarks he made about Republicans in Congress, and that his name appeared on a 9/11 conspiracy petition.

The part that is remembered, and still resonates today, Jones said, is the section envisioning a future of racial harmony and justice.\n\"What's the future we're fighting for now?\" Jones said. \"Because if you can't explain that to people, you're just going to have a bunch of bad statistics, some interesting legislative proposals, and a bunch of white guilt. ... and very little progress in these (underserved) communities.\"\nJones drew on the common name between Martin Luther King and Trayvon Martin   the black teenager from Florida whose story became national news after he was fatally shot by neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman   to show that the country still has room to improve regarding race relations.\nHe argued that improving both race relations and the outlook for young blacks and Latinos has long-term economic benefits.\n\"You could have 10,000 Mark Zuckerbergs,\" Jones said, referring to the CEO and co-founder of Facebook. \"But a whole lot of them could look like Trayvon Martin.\"\nContact Laith Agha via email at lagha@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: CNN correspondent Van Jones gets his photograph taken with Cliff Fried on Wednesday, Jan. 15, 2014, in San Rafael, Calif.

The updated proposal suggests building 105 units on the 3.5-acre site.\n\"Our proposal today is closer to 30 units per acre,\" Gruendl said. \"The older apartment buildings out behind Marin Joe's and out toward Peet's, as calculated by your town staff, have densities as high as 50 units per acre.\" \nThe updated proposal includes building one- and two-bedroom apartments in two- and three-story buildings, instead of having one of the buildings as tall as four stories. There would also be sub-level parking beneath the apartments.\nNeighbors first learned of the proposed development in October when Gruendl and his associates invited about 100 neighbors of the complex to a meeting at the Best Western Corte Madera Inn. Attendees viewed the plans and were horrified by the sketches, citing concerns about increased traffic congestion, water availability, local school capacity and a lack of parking.\nThey also raised concerns about the proposed apartments being similar to the 180-unit apartment complex at the former WinCup site on Tamal Vista Boulevard in Corte Madera. The highly-visible development is a sore subject for those who feel it's too massive.\nAt the second meeting Wednesday, all of those same concerns were aired and a majority of the crowd was raucous and outspoken about their hatred of the proposed development. While many argued nothing new should be built at the site at all, others said they'd be more supportive of the idea if there were fewer than 105 units.\nCorte Madera resident Milena Belloni said the proposed development needs to be smaller and fit into the surrounding community.\n\"I don't think any of us are opposed to change, we just want it done right,\" Belloni said. \"There's a limit to how much you can do in the county.\"\nFor Christie Diederick the proposed apartment complex is personal. She lives at the Marin Gardens apartments and would have to relocate if Gruendl's proposed development is built. She said more luxury apartments aren't needed in the community, and affordable housing is hard to come by.\n\"The community there is really beautiful right now,\" Diederick said. \"The people who stay should get to stay with their current rental rate.\"\nGruendl said he's still trying to determine whether the complex might include 10 or 20 percent of its apartments as affordable units. He said most of the luxury apartments that he hopes to build on the site in 2015 for 2016 move-in dates would rent for $2,700 in today's market.\nNot everyone was outraged by the proposed development. David Kunhardt, who ran for a seat on the Corte Madera Town Council in November, said he was pleased with the changes Gruendl made.\n\"I think it was a good thing for him to listen and come back with a density that's 25 percent lower than his prior proposal and also limiting it to three stories,\" Kunhardt said.\nDespite the changes, the development would still hinge on the town's passage of a zoning amendment, increasing the allowed density on the site. The site is zoned for low-density multi-dwellings with a maximum of 10.9 units per acre.\nAny sort of discussion about rezoning the property has yet to take place as BayRock Multifamily has not filed any official plans with the town, according to Planning Director Dan Bell.\n\"Anything beyond what's allowed right now would necessitate a general plan amendment and zoning amendment,\" Bell said.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

Sears cited concerns that included the deck, noting it intruded on privacy of the neighbors.\nCounty planners had voted 4-3 to eliminate the deck but uphold height and related conditions imposed by a zoning administrator.\nAt issue were plans for a 2,935-square-foot home, 297-square-foot guest house and 343-square-foot garage proposed by Kenneth Werner at 174 Seadrift Road in the exclusive Seadrift subdivison of Stinson Beach. An existing 1,340-square-foot house will be demolished.\nWerner appealed conditions imposed by county staff to the commission, including cutting the 22.45-foot building height by two feet. The the commission approved the height reduction   and eliminated the barbecue deck, saying it intruded on the privacy of neighbor Mark Schweitzer's patio, hot tub and outdoor shower area.\nWerner then appealed to the county board. Supervisors backed the height reduction but restored plans for the deck.\nArchitect Steve Wisenbaker, noting federal rules requiring elevated construction in light of sea-surge storm concerns, said his novel home design incorporating a narrow beachfront structure was the best bet for everyone, especially those on the beach. \"This proposal has the least impact to the public, the neighbors ... of any FEMA home\" on the beach, he said, noting it did not \"wall off\" the lot. Peter Sandmann, an attorney representing the Seadrift Association, agreed the design \"limits the impact\" of federal rules.\nAlthough neighbor Schweitzer protested the deck directly overlooks his outdoor retreat, Wisenbaker asserted screening will protect privacy.\nSupervisor Steve Kinsey, pressing a motion cutting the building height while retaining the deck, said that in light of rocketing values for beach property, older Seadrift homes that sell for \"millions\" are being torn down to make way for new homes.\n\"We're not talking about a typical neighborhood,\" Kinsey noted.\nSupervisor Susan Adams joined in reluctant agreement, but cited concerns about water use by the bigger home   and indicated that in light of hurricane damage to beach homes on the East Coast, moving construction inland may be appropriate.\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

No river otter counts have been taken because the mammal is not considered endangered.\nExperts, however, suspect the comeback is linked to a 1962 ban on otter trapping; a 1972 federal law to reduce pollution in rivers, creeks, and bays; plus a series of creek cleanup and environmental restoration projects.\nScientists also believe the otter, a sleek carnivore weighing up to 31 pounds that had been hunted for its pelt, is learning how to adapt to living in the territory of humans.\n\"They were persecuted for so long by people. The trapping really hit their numbers. Now they have been adapting to us,\" said Steve Bobzien, an East Bay Regional Park District wildlife biologist who has studied large river otters in South America. \"They are charismatic, playful, and smart, and they're so cute.\"\nAs river otters became scarce or nearly vanished from the urban Bay Area, they still were commonly seen in more rural, less developed areas like the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. The otters easily swim in rivers, creeks, bays and canals, and are able to tolerate some saltwater.\nA few years ago, Isadore started noticing river otters poking their noses out of the water in Lagunitas Creek. Others have also come up from the bay and spent time in the canal, the lagoons in Corte Madera and in Corte Madera Creek, eating fish along the way. In 2011 and 2012 otters were hit and killed by cars, prompting \"otter crossing\" signs to be put up on Lucky Drive.\nThey have also turned up on docks in the San Rafael Canal and along the county's rugged West Marin coast.\nAnother otter, dubbed \"Sutro Sam,\" became a media sensation a year ago when he swam into the Sutro Baths at San Francisco's Ocean Beach and feasted on fish for several months before leaving.\nIn 2012, Isadore launched the River Otter Ecology Project  www.riverotterecology.org . The group's first order of business was to create a website with an interactive map where local \"Otter Spotters\" could chart their sightings. Since then, the once empty map has exploded with sightings throughout the Bay Area.\nEither unnoticed or gone from the Bay Area three decades ago, the otters have also been spotted in Los Gatos, Oakland, Fremont, Martinez, Walnut Creek, Richmond, Berkeley, Napa, Lafayette and elsewhere in the Bay Area.\nIn cooperation with the Point Reyes National Seashore, Muir Woods National Monument, the National Park Service, local and state parks, the otter project is monitoring 100 miles of coastline. The group's growing team of volunteers has placed more than 20 infrared, motion-sensitive cameras throughout the territory to monitor the otters' activities.\nIJ reporter Mark Prado contributed to this report\nRiver otter facts\n* Northern American river otters are sleek, agile and playful members of the weasel family that live in and along rivers, creeks, marshes and coastlines. They feast on fish and crayfish in water, and frogs, small mammals, insects and even birds on land.\n* River otters can be up to 42 inches long and weigh between 11 and 31 pounds. Males average about 25 pounds. California sea otters weigh from 31 to 99 pounds and can reach about 5 feet in length.\n* Unlike the sea otter, which is slow on land, the river otter has a different skeletal structure that allows it to walk and run quickly on land.\n* Cute as otters are, wildlife experts warn not to corner them as they have sharp teeth.\n* Although it is called a river otter, this otter can tolerate both fresh and brackish water and a variety of water temperatures.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: A river otter swims in a marsh at Big Break Regional Shoreline on Friday, Dec. 20, 2013 in Oakley, Calif.

Written by San Francisco playwright Marisela Trevi\u00d2o Orta, it's a world premiere developed within the first season of company's playwright residency program, AlterLab. The play is already a cowinner of Arizona Theatre Company's 2013 National Latino Playwriting Award (shared with Caridad Svich's \"Spark\"). This is the first time that AlterTheater has presented two plays in repertory, as Sam Shepard's \"Fool for Love\" joins this show in rotation. \"The River Bride\" will also be the first of the company's shows to go on to play American Conservatory Theater's Costume Shop Theater in San Francisco after its San Rafael run.\nBut all that is secondary to the real reason to be excited about \"The River Bride,\" which is that it's a captivating play. A Grimm-style fairy tale based on Brazilian folk tales, it's a bittersweet love story that uses poetic language and a mythic atmosphere of unreality to haunting effect. \nIt's the tale of two sisters: Belmira, the younger (an effectively exasperating Livia Demarchi), is a flighty and mercenary beauty who can't let her sister have anything without grabbing it for herself, while Helena (a touchingly soulful Carla Pauli) is stern and serious and almost cripplingly self-effacing. Belmira is about to be married to a handsome young fisherman (Adam Roy), whom she hopes will take her away from their tiny fishing village on the Amazon River where everybody knows each other and nobody has much money (or, seemingly, much use for it).\nAside from the upcoming wedding, the only real excitement in town is the sudden appearance of an immaculately well-dressed stranger (a charismatic Nick Garcia), whom the sisters' father literally fishes out of the river. This enigmatic young man, Moises (gotta love that name), is awfully vague about who he is and where he comes from, but he starts wooing the long-neglected elder sister like there's no tomorrow. Their courtship is tender and tentative and awfully sweet, gently nudged along by Helena's kind-hearted parents. (Cathleen Riddley is warm and upbeat as the insightful mother, and Matt Kizer softly amiable as the dad.) But, of course, Moises has a secret that will have to come out. Heck, everybody has secrets haunting them, and it's a question of whether or not they can successfully navigate them to find each other.\nCodirected by Ann Brebner and Jeanette Harrison, AlterTheater's production maintains the slightly dreamlike quality of a fairy tale while also achingly conveying the emotional turmoil bubbling beneath the surface, especially of Pauli's conflicted Helena. Wiljago Cook's set is just a few large wooden blocks painted pink and gray, with the barest suggestion of a dock behind them, but it effectively evokes the world of the play when combined with Selina G Young's moody blue lights and Madeleine Oldham's burbling water sounds.\nThere are some beautiful passages expressing the deep connection with the river and the timelessness of heartbreak. It's always very clear what's going on with the otherworldly element of the play and more or less where it's headed, although even then there are some surprises in store. Some of the earthly events are a little less clear, particularly regarding Belmira's engagement, but it's not really necessary to have all the blanks filled in. Orta does an admirable job with exposition in the play, having people say pretty much exactly what's going on inside them without it feeling contrived or overly repetitive. Because, as with any good fairy tale, ultimately we know that this is a story, and this is how the story is told.\nSam Hurwitt's theater blog, The Idiolect, is atwww.theidiolect.com .

After more than a decade in the making, allowing for a few more weeks for public comment is a reasonable move.\nThe time extension is the second, this time moving the deadline from Jan. 11 to Feb. 17.\nThe National Park Service's draft plan calls for limiting the trails and beaches in the GGNRA where dogs would be allowed to romp without being held by a leash. In Marin, the draft plan would require dogs to be on leash at Muir Beach.\nThe GGNRA's 2011 plan, which was never implemented and is now being revised, had banned dogs from the beach.\nCurrently, dogs are allowed off-leash, but under voice command.\nThat's the way it should be, according to many dog owners, who say letting dogs run off-leash is part of their enjoyment of the parkland.\nThey haven't gotten much support from park officials and environmentalists, who say that leashes are necessary as a safety measure and to protect the park's sensitive wildlife areas.\nDog owners have already succeeded in their legal challenge of the 2011 rules and forced GGNRA to almost re-boot its process.\nExtending the deadline is a wise move, especially in response to one of the biggest complaints about the 2011 rules.\nThe park service, in its latest draft plan, demonstrated its willingness to come up with a plan that was less sweeping and more reflective of different areas and uses in the many and varied park opportunities GGNRA's 80,000 acres have to offer.\nThe difference between Point Reyes National Seashore or the Muir Woods National Monument and GGNRA is that Golden Gate was established as a \"recreation\" area. To many people, exercising their dogs is part of the recreation regimen. A change in the rules should be based on facts and science.\nThe park service, in its latest draft, is showing an interest in accommodating that activity in many parts of the park. The goal of the draft plan is to also respond to concerns about safety and environmental protection.\nThere should be a fair process that leads to a reasonable solution.\nThe debate is politically charged. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution opposing the draft plan, calling it \"progressive dimunition\" of public access.\nLast month, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, asked park officials to extend the comment period and reminded officials about off-leash areas that people enjoyed before the land in San Francisco was transferred from the city into GGNRA.\nThe extension provides the public more time to detail their support, opposition and questions about proposed changes.\nThose comments and concerns deserve to be part of a process that should be open, fair and deliberative.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Unleashed dogs play in the surf on Friday, Jan. 14, 2011, in Muir Beach, Calif.

Magnetic north. Grid north. These directional terms are important for explorers, sailors and pretty much anyone who needs to use a map to get where he or she's going. If you're going for pizza, True North will take you to San Anselmo's newest pizza restaurant.\n\"It's a fun, familiar name,\" says owner Buck Minitch. Minitch, who spent eight years in the Marine Corps, is also intimately familiar with the many usages of \"north.\" Taking advantage of a double entendre, True North Artisan Pizza & Craft Beer uses the North Pole, or the North Star, Polaris, as a guide in its pizza philosophy and design. \nCompass-enabled or not, pizza fans will find well-made pizza at True North Artisan Pizza, which opened Nov. 1, in the space that was briefly Zio Pizza, before that, Lo Coco's. Many of the menu items are from Lo Coco's menu (Minitch has Lo Coco's recipes), and many dishes like the Caesar salad ($5) and garlic bread ($5) are the same as they once were.\nMinitch tweaked Lo Coco's crust recipe and, though he would not reveal any ingredients or cooking techniques (leaving one to wonder, what is true pizza?), the crust seemed to be a bit softer and stretchier than under previous ownership. The house crust is the foundation of many items, including the garlic bread and the bruschetta ($7). Shaped and served like a mini-pizza, the bruschetta boasted beautiful, sweet tomatoes, brightened with fresh basil. Pizzas are small (10 inches, $14) or large (14 inches, $22). Our combo arrived with a blistered crust, had a soft, subtle crunch and a pleasant chew.\nNot so the gluten-free pizza. Though Minitch assured me that he has taken steps to correct the problem, the crust on the gluten-free pizza I ordered was so firm, it was difficult to chew and left me with an achy jaw. Minitch and his chefs developed their own gluten-free crust, and take pains to ensure these pizzas are prepared and cooked separately from gluten-bearing pizzas. Perhaps now, post-revision, the cooking method produces more favorable results.\nTrue North also has calzones ($12, meat or veggie) and pasta, such as the penne sienna ($14), topped with a luscious cream and pesto-infused red sauce, but pizza is the name of the game here. An expanded menu of barbecue ribs and wings, hot dogs, wienerschnitzel, sliders and soup is expected shortly.\nWith a guiding motto of \"no beers owned or made by Coors, Miller or Bud,\" Minitch is developing a craft beer program to pair with the pizzas. A few familiar names are here among the 20 or so beers, such as Napa Smith pale ale (12 ounces, $5) and Abita amber (12 ounces, $5) but as the list grows to 70, including 10 draft beers (permit pending), expect more unique choices like the Nectar Humboldt brown hemp ale (12 ounces, $5). A short list of wines, all $7 a glass or $28 for a bottle, and a few ciders ($5 to $15) round out the list.\nWorn red booths still line the walls, but True North's single, large room has undergone a bit of remodeling. The rafters are gone, exposing a girder ceiling that resembles a bridge's latticework. Photos of bridges hang from the freshly painted red walls. The lighting, redone by Minitch, features small bulbs hung from long cables. You could say the pinpoint lighting resembles stars, but that might be stretching the star metaphor a bit too far.\nHalf the room has smaller caf\u00c8 tables, turned to watch the musician strumming a guitar in the corner. Live music six nights a week and at Sunday brunch adds bounce, enlivening the room. The atmosphere is convivial. Kids and parents might get up to dance or to chat with Minitch and the musicians. Some switch seats after dining to listen more attentively.\nRefusing to be pinned down by pizza style, True North's philosophy can best be summed up by the experience. Well-made pizza and small batch beer go well together. Throw in some live music that entertains the kids and relaxes the adults and you have yourself a party. Once the sun and a few beers go down, those lights may become stars after all.\nChristina Mueller writes about food   restaurants, chefs, products and trends   for local and national publications as well as other industry clients.

Marin Municipal Water District should follow suit.\nWhy is the board delaying action in imposing prudent rationing?\nWhat we're seeing is unprecedented, extreme variation in seasonal weather patterns. Couple that with the fact that Marin has vastly more residents than it did during the previously worst recorded drought of 1929. In that year, Marin tallied almost twice as much water (19 inches) than our county received for the entire calendar year of 2013 (10.68 inches).\nObviously we have a reservoir system now that we didn't back then.\nBut still Marin is in a chronic deficit position in regard to water, importing 25 percent annually from Sonoma. \nWouldn't it be prudent to act now, so the rationing is less painful later?\nWhat can the MMWD board be thinking (or contemplating)?\nHow do its directors see themselves and their mission? Are they public resource stewards? Businessmen? Or poker players   holding the desal plant construction card? And in what combination?\nOh my, they have us guessing.\nPeter Hensel, Corte Madera\n'Forward-looking action'\nA significant number of Marin residents have no experience of life under a severe water rationing scenario.\nFor those of us who well remember 1976-77, it's a huge inconvenience.\nIt is admirable that Marin Municipal Water District is not overreacting with early rationing and is making a public relations effort to reduce use now.\nBut we are about halfway through January with nary a drop. Unless we have a February or March \"miracle,\" we are headed into a very rough water year.\nWater dependent businesses, like restaurants, will be especially hard hit if we have to eventually go to 25 percent rationing.\nTo ease or delay this possibility to the maximum extent possible, instead of waiting for April, the district should consider an early phased-in rationing approach to begin to condition adults and children alike.\nIf January remains dry, the district should consider an immediate mandatory 10 percent cutback on residential use.\nAs we learned previously, water is a finite resource, and rationing is an education process, so an earlier start is advantageous for many good reasons.\nFor commercial users, the district could consider a water credit incentive program to reduce year-to-year comparative consumption.\nFor example, for every commercial cubic-foot savings under voluntary reductions now, to help ease their burden, commercial users could earn a double credit, should widespread rationing be required later this year.\nIf significant rain does appear and early-year rationing can be curtailed, few if any would fault the directors for being proactive by taking early, forward-looking action.\nLarry Minikes, San Rafael\nReason for caution\nIt won't take a visit from Punxsutawney Phil to tell us that Marin County is in for a hard drought this year.\nI walk Mount Tamalpais a few times a week and I can see and feel the dry winds and the warmth of a high pressure system settling in above our area. It's shown little willingness to move east.\nThe beauty is marred only by the ever-spreading gray of dead shrubs and young trees that aren't getting enough water this year. I hope those who join me up on the mountain will remain ever vigilant and forthright when confronted by the possible fire dangers.\nI was raised in the Santa Monica Mountains and I have seen a small spark turn into a raging inferno that's burned down whole neighborhoods, killed pets and ruined the lives of thousands.\nWe should practice good citizenship by remembering to carry our cellphone in case we see a fire.\nLet's be be careful out there.\nJohn Thomas Ellis, Kentfield\nSAN ANSELMO\nObeying the rules\nDick Spotswood writes in his Jan. 8 column that Ford Greene was not selected as mayor of San Anselmo by his colleagues because he \"rubbed some colleagues the wrong way last time he held the mayor's gavel.\"\nThe actual reasons why the San Anselmo Town Council chose not to select him as its mayor at its Dec. 10 meeting are contained in the recording of that meeting, which is available to the public (including IJ columnists) athttp://www.sanhub.com/ .\nThe reasons discussed related to the fact that Mr. Greene has an ongoing fight with the town in which he is appealing a unanimous decision by the Planning Commission. The commission affirmed a town staff decision, rejecting Mr. Greene's arguments that, unlike all other properties in town, state and local fire and building codes should not apply to his basement living unit.\nIndeed, as stated at the meeting, Mr. Greene told at least one of the council members that he will sue the town in federal court should his effort to avoid having these laws apply to him fail.\nThe council members indicated that, in light of his adverse position to the town and its staff and his threatened litigation against them, it was not in the town's best interests to select him as its top leader and spokesperson.\nThis decision seems reasonable and in the best interests of the town.\nWould Mr. Spotswood, a former Mill Valley elected official, have selected as his mayor someone who was in the midst of a personal financial dispute with the city and was planning to sue.\nMany people do not realize that the mayor position is largely ceremonial and is a privilege earned by members of local councils for the work they do and the examples they set as public servants.\nCarla Overberger, San Anselmo, Former Planning Commissioner\nenvironment\nAppreciation for leashes\nI love going to the beach and watching dogs run loose and play. I generally like dogs but don't have one, so for me this is a nice way to enjoy them.\nI'm also an avid hiker and mountain biker, and enjoy exploring the fabulous trails we have here locally and elsewhere.\nWhenever I have encountered an unleashed dog on a single track hiking trail my first instinct is to prepare to defend myself. This is because I have no way of knowing whether the dog is going to be aggressive or not, and we are both going to have to be in close proximity to one another due to the narrow space available on the trail.\nThis is quite different than being on a wide open beach, or in a dog park.\nHaving been attacked twice by aggressive dogs, including being bitten by a friend's dogs at their home, I hate to say it, but I am somewhat fearful now when I encounter unleashed dogs.\nIs this the way dog owners want others to respond to their beloved four-legged friends?\nLeash your dog in the parks, unless there is open space for them to romp, and spare the rest of us from having to wonder whether we are about to be attacked.\nTom Short, San Rafael\nNATIONAL POLITICS\nExperience counts\nI'm just not convinced that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is the right person to send to Washington to solve gridlock.\nRandy Warren, San Rafael", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 15"}, {"relevance": [213.0], "text": "Wednesday's local events\nHIGH SCHOOL BOYS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nMarin Catholic vs. Branson           7:30 p.m.           COM\nHIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nMarin Catholic vs. Branson           6 p.m.           COM\nThursday's local events \nCOLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nCOM at Contra Costa           7:30 p.m.           San Pablo\nCOLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nCOM at Contra Costa           5:30 p.m.           San Pablo\nHIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nMarin Academy at Sacred Heart           5:30 p.m.           San Francisco\nON THE AIR WednesDAY\nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL           Time           TV           Radio\nAuburn at Tennessee           4 p.m.           CSNCA\nNotre Dame at Maryland           4 p.m.           ESPN2\nSouth Florida at SMU           4 p.m.           ESPNU\nBaylor at Texas Tech           6 p.m.           ESPNU\nLSU at Mississippi           6 p.m.           CSNCA\nWashington State at Stanford           7 p.m.           P12BA           1050 AM\nWashington at Cal           8 p.m.           ESPNU           810 AM\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL           Time           TV           Radio\nCollegiate Bowl Practice           10 a.m.           ESPNU\nCollegiate Bowl Practice           1 p.m.           ESPNU\nGOLF           Time           TV           Radio\nHSBC Championship           1 a.m.           Golf\nNBA           Time           TV           Radio\nUtah at San Antonio           5 p.m.           ESPN\nDenver at Golden State           7:30 p.m.           ESPN, CSN           680 AM\nNHL           Time           TV           Radio\nWashington at Pittsburgh           5 p.m.           NBCS\nSOCCER           Time           TV           Radio\nEPL: Fulham vs Sunderland           8 p.m.           CSNCA*\nTENNIS           Time           TV           Radio\nAustralian Open: Second Round           noon           ESPN2*\nAustralian Open: Second Round           6 p.m.           ESPN2\nAustralian Open: Second Round           midnight           ESPN2\nON THE AIR ThursDAY\nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL           Time           TV           Radio\nWhiparound Coverage           3:30 p.m.           ESPNU\nBelmont at Eastern Kentucky           4 p.m.           ESPNU\nConnecticut at Memphis           4 p.m.           ESPN\nMissouri at Vanderbilt           4 p.m.           ESPN2\nUCLA at Colorado           5 p.m.           P12BA\nBYU at San Francisco           6 p.m.           ESPNU\nOhio State at Minnesota           6 p.m.           ESPN2\nGonzaga at Pepperdine           7 p.m.           CSN\nUSC at Utah           7 p.m.           P12BA\nLong Beach State at UCSB           8 p.m.           ESPNU\nNBA           Time           TV           Radio\nNew York at Indiana           4 p.m.           TNT\nOklahoma City at Houston           6:30 p.m.           TNT\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL           Time           TV           Radio\nCollegiate Bowl practice           10 a.m.           ESPNU\nCollegiate Bowl practice           1 p.m.           ESPNU\nGOLF           Time           TV           Radio\nHumana Challenge           noon           Golf\nAbu Dhabi Championship           1 a.m. (Fri.)

Delicious. Delectable. The deviled egg. This eggscellent hors d'oeuvre is making its way from the picnic table to the silver tray. Kathy Casey's \"D'Lish Deviled Eggs: A Collection of Recipes from Creative to Classic,\" is an ode to the egg and its rise in appetizer ranks.\nCasey begins with a brief history of the egg and how-tos on preparing and piping. Then she gives us \"egg-ceptional ideas\" for how to serve deviled eggs at every holiday meal of the year, including Eggs Benedict Day (April 16) and World Egg Day (Oct. 11). She also makes recipe suggestions for events from the regal (weddings) to restrained (summer picnics). \nThis impressive collection of more than 50 recipes includes everything from international cuisine like firecracker barbecue pork and Thai curry-spiced deviled eggs with shrimp to American standards like retro shrimp cocktail, red hot buffalo and bacon cheddar, to interesting like corned beef and sauerkraut, devilish green eggs and ham, and pumpkin pie deviled eggs.\nLooking for a recipe to prepare, I skipped the classics like grandma's old-fashioned and went for the sophisticated   deviled quail eggs and caviar. Inventive, but expensive. I also chose the intriguing, budget-friendly Indian curry. The recipe was easy to follow and the cumin and mango chutney in the egg were delicious.\nThe dirty martini and bloody Mary recipes each called for alcohol. I was cooking in the morning so I prepared the bloody Mary. The recipe calls for the horseradish, Worcestershire, celery seeds to be mixed with the mayonnaise and yolk, leaving the veggies and vodka for the topping. Delicious.\nAnother favorite was the smoked salmon with sour cream and chives. It was easy to make and elegant on the table.\n\"D'Lish Deviled Eggs\" proves the deviled egg is more than an old appetizer making a retro comeback. It is an art form.\nRECIPES\nBloody Mary deviled eggs\nMakes 24 deviled eggs\nFilling\n\u03a9 cup mayonnaise\n1 tablespoon prepared horseradish\n1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce\n\u03a9 teaspoon Tabasco sauce\n\u00ba teaspoon celery seeds\n\u00ba teaspoon salt\nTopping\n\u03a9 cup tiny diced tomatoes\n2 tablespoons minced celery\n4 teaspoons minced pimento-stuffed green olives\n1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice\n2 teaspoon vodka\nHalve the eggs lengthwise and transfer the yolks to a mixing bowl. Set the egg white halves on a platter, cover and refrigerate.\nWith a fork, mash the yolks to a smooth consistency. Add the mayonnaise, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, celery seeds and salt, and mix until smooth. (You can also do this using an electric mixer with a whip attachment.) Taste and season accordingly.\nSpoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a plain or large star tip, then pipe the mixture evenly into the egg white halves. Or fill the eggs with a spoon, dividing equally. To make the topping, in a small bowl, mix together the tomatoes, celery, olives, lemon juice and vodka. Top each egg half with about 1 teaspoon of the mixture.\nIndian curry\nMakes 24 deviled eggs\n3 tablespoons mayonnaise\n3 tablespoons plain yogurt\n\u00ba to \u03a9 teaspoons Tabasco sauce\n2 teaspoons curry powder\n\u00ba to \u03a9 teaspoons salt\n2 tablespoons dried currants\n2 tablespoons minced celery\nFilling\n2 tablespoons mango chutney\n24 small minced parsley leaves\nHalve the eggs lengthwise and transfer the yolks into a mixing bowl.

The court then has discretion to schedule the matter for a felony jury trial later this year.\nRichards, described by Sheriff Bob Doyle as \"a model prisoner,\" has been a county jail resident since he was captured in the Philippines last summer on a federal fugitive warrant.\nIn the criminal justice system it's always possible that a pre-trial plea bargain will be reached between District Attorney Ed Berberian's office and Richards. \nThe former sewer honcho is charged with absconding with $339,000 of district funds.\nIf Richards is found guilty or cops a plea, in addition to a period of incarceration followed by probation, it's likely that a court will order that he make restitution for the missing cash.\nMarin's recent history of these orders actually resulting in full restitution to defrauded public entities is mixed.\nExample one is the curious case of Richard Mollenkopf.\nIn 1990, Mollenkopf was the well-regarded chief of the Ross Valley Fire Service. His arrest came as a huge shock.\nThe fire chief was charged with a series of bizarre actions, including a bomb plot and embezzlement of public funds.\nSentenced to state prison, Mollenkopf was order to pay Ross Valley Fire Service $408,730 along with $55,262 in costs plus interest.\nEven after being forced to sell his real property, the disgraced fire chief still owed Ross Valley Fire a six-figure sum.\nOver two decades, Mollenkopf's debt has been accruing interest at 10 percent compounded annually. The fire service's administration estimated last year that the debt now totals $696,745.\nProspects of collection appear dim even though criminal restitution orders are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.\nThe failure to collect Mollenkopf's debt isn't due to inadvertence. Two former Ross Valley Fire Service directors, former Fairfax mayor Frank Egger and retired San Anselmo Mayor Paul Chignell never gave up the chase. San Anselmo Councilman Ford Greene also is pushing collection. To this day, they all remain determined that the restitution judgment be fully honored.\nEgger, in his current role as a Ross Valley Sanitary District director, knows from this experience that a restitution order is no guarantee that Brett Richards will ever make the public's treasury whole.\nThat's especially true given that Richards, unlike Mollenkopf owns no traceable real estate or other assets that Ross Valley Sanitary District might attach to settle his debt.\nThat may be the greatest irony.\nRichards' unsecured loan of taxpayers' funds, the subject of all of his travails, was made for \"housing.\" According to the DA's quite thorough forensic accountant, instead of buying real property, that in the current resurgent economy would likely have soared in value, Richards illegally frittered away most of his allegedly ill-gained loot on overseas trips and high living.\nOf course Richards, who has pleaded not guilty, could be acquitted. Even in that event the money is still gone and collection prospects remain slim.\nlll\nI RECENTLY WROTE that because of a redistricting quirk, Marin hasn't been represented in the California state Senate since 2012. That column stated that the state senate's leadership hadn't funded any staff to aid Sen. Noreen Evans, D-Santa Rosa, in her role as Marin's so-called \"caretaker senator.\"\nEvans does have a senate-supplied Marin staffer, Carole Mills, with an office at the Civic Center.

Board president Natu Tuatagaloa said district staff will be directed to investigate the matter further.\nEstavillo, who holds a doctor of education degree from Harvard University, became the Bahia Vista principal prior to the 2012-13 school year. She joined the district in 2007 as a teacher at San Pedro Elementary School. Estavillo did not respond to multiple phone messages seeking comment.\nThe school district declined comment on the matter in an email from Superintendent Michael Watenpaugh's office: \"Because this is a personnel matter, it is a privacy issue for San Rafael City Schools. As a district, we are required to protect the confidentiality and rights of both students and staff; therefore, we are unable to comment in any way at this time.\"\nSeveral other school officials and staff, including Tuatagaloa, trustee Paul Cohen and teachers association president Kay O'Donnell, did not respond to inquiries from the Independent Journal.\nThe claim that Estavillo \"has shown a lack of willingness to speak with students and parents\" was supported during the board meeting by five Bahia Vista parents who spoke during the meeting's public comment period. Three of the parents spoke Spanish, and had their comments translated into English for the trustees.\nThey described interactions with the principal, in which they approached Estavillo to discuss problems involving their children. But they said Estavillo showed limited interest or ability to address the issues. One mother said she felt like she had to teach the principal how to help her son.\nThe claims are in stark contrast to the praise Estavillo received from the district when she was promoted. In a 2012 press release announcing Estavillo's appointment, she was lauded for being well qualified for the job.\n\"Gloria's professional experience, her personal attributes, and her familiarity with the district and greater San Rafael community, represent the essential skills and talents that are highly desired in our leaders for San Rafael City Schools, and are exceptionally well matched for Bahia Vista,\" the statement read.\nContact Laith Agha via email atlagha@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Gloria Estavillo is pictured in April of 2012 after she was named principal at Bahia Vista School in San Rafael.

The April ruling overturned a lower court decision from 2009 that sided with Equity LifeStyle Properties, stating the city's ordinance constituted a government \"taking\" of private property. \nCity Attorney Rob Epstein said the decisions made by the circuit court and Supreme Court once and for all affirm the validity of the city's law   even if it took a huge chunk of time to do so.\n\"I don't think anyone could have anticipated when this case began that it would take this long for it to conclude. I don't think the city ever thought this fight was going to be easy, but 14 years is an unusually long time for litigation,\" Epstein said.\nMayor Gary Phillips said he's happy the Supreme Court has effectively ended further time spent in court on the issue.\n\"We anticipated that would be their ruling and we're quite pleased it has come to a conclusion,\" Phillips said.\nLandowner Equity LifeStyle Properties said the Supreme Court's decision won't help new tenants moving into Contempo Marin.\n\"The trial court found after a full trial that the city's rent control ordinance does not make housing more affordable, a conclusion the court of appeals did not dispute and the Supreme Court did not review. Instead, the ordinance forces new residents to pay more up front to get into the community than they would have to pay without the ordinance. Our customers are overwhelmingly satisfied with the quality and pricing of the communities and lifestyle we provide without the need for rent control,\" said Equity LifeStyle Properties spokeswoman Jennifer Ludovice in a statement.\nBut most homeowners are happy with the outcome of the case and plan to attend a future City Council meeting en masse to express their gratitude.\nKeith Meloney, president of the Contempo Marin Homeowners Association, said he's thankful to the city for standing behind its ordinance and protecting Contempo Marin residents.\n\"This case comes to a final close and it lands where residents who have purchased properties can enjoy the same benefit others enjoy. We recaptured equity preservation,\" Meloney said. \"Our buyers will be buying rent-controlled property and therefore our equity is able to be recovered.\"\nWhile Contempo Marin residents own their homes, they lease space from Equity LifeStyle Properties. The city's ordinance, enacted in 1989, is meant to keep the mobile home park affordable.\nIn 1993 and 1999 the ordinance underwent revisions that made it so the park's owners couldn't increase rents beyond 75 percent of the change in housing prices per the Consumer Price Index. It also gave new residents moving onto a vacant pad in the park the right to rent the space at the same rate as the previous tenant.\nMeloney said the 2009 ruling siding with the landowner devastated the community by allowing the owner to increase rents to nearly $2,000 a month   triple what he had been paying   hurting resale value of the homes and causing more than 70 people to abandon their residences and mortgages.\nHe said the property company knew it was buying rent-controlled land, so why it sought to challenge that fact remains a mystery.\n\"They bought a regulated piece of land at a regulated price level,\" Meloney said.\nThe argument over rent began in 2000 when the park sued the city, claiming the ordinance unfairly targeted them and caused them to lose 81 percent of the value of the community by disallowing rent increases. A settlement was reached in July 2001, but residents urged the City Council to back out of it, prompting the park's owner to add to the suit accusations that the city breached the settlement agreement.\nIn November 2002, a jury ruled in favor of the city on the settlement issue, but it held off on other matters pending a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a case involving the oil industry.\nIn August 2004, the park's owner filed a second lawsuit seeking monetary damages. The district court dismissed the complaint in December 2006, stating the company had already waived its monetary damages as part of the first lawsuit.\nIn May 2005, the Supreme Court ruled on the oil industry case, shooting down a theory about regulatory takings that had been the basis of the park company's claim. The company amended its complaint in February 2006.\nAfter a second bench trial in May 2007, the district court issued a final judgment in 2009 favoring the company. The city opted to seek appellate review and won its appeal in April 2013.\nDespite feelings of elation with the Supreme Court decision, Meloney said residents are concerned about what the property owner might do next.\n\"They've made plenty of threats about closing the park if they lose the lawsuit,\" Meloney said. \"Now we see.\"\nEpstein said he's aware of those threats, but the city hasn't focused on or investigated the landowner's next steps. He said closing the park would suggest the property owner wants to do something else with the land, requiring a potential change in zoning.\n\"If such a proposal came, we'd evaluate it at that time,\" Epstein said.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

Within the past week the nonprofit has launched a new program aimed at making connections in San Rafael. \nNarayan Khalsa, 26, and Ben Dougherty, 20, have been hired by the nonprofit to canvass places like Boyd Memorial Park for homeless young people. Both are making the transition out of homelessness themselves and looking for ways to help other young adults do the same.\n\"At this stage we're just trying to talk to them and develop some kind of relationship and let them know what's out there,\" Khalsa said. \"It's hard to develop trust with people.\"\nThe idea behind the program, which was created by Khalsa and two other formerly homeless youths involved with the nonprofit, is that homeless young people will be more responsive to generational peers, especially those who have walked in their shoes.\nDougherty said so far the effort has been viewed favorably.\n\"They've welcomed us more warmly than we've anticipated,\" Dougherty said. \"They've been open with us about changes they want in their lives.\"\nThus far the two men have met young homeless people who want to improve their lives, but are having trouble finding jobs because of their criminal records. The lack of affordable housing and not having a stable place to live were also listed as barriers.\nThose who want to help themselves and meet other homeless youths are encouraged to attend weekly meetings at Ambassadors of Hope and Opportunity's new San Rafael office, next to Saint Raphael Church on Fifth Avenue. There Zara Babitzke, the nonprofit's founder and executive director, helps them obtain an assortment of services ranging from haircuts to transitional housing.\nBut Babitzke said it's the young people who really help each other by creating an emotionally supportive environment where people can share their troubles and feel supported.\n\"They really take care of one another,\" Babitzke said.\nOne 20-year-old homeless man who attends the nonprofit's meetings and has been helped by Babitzke said the program is a great idea, and he hopes to become involved.\n\"It takes somebody who lived it. You can't just approach somebody and say 'Hey I can smell you from around the block, you might be homeless, let's talk,'\" he said.\nThe College of Marin student has been homeless for about a year and wished to remain anonymous. He said his parents kicked him out of the house when he graduated high school.\nWith no home and nothing to do, he began to drink alcohol in large quantities during the summer, but said he has since stopped. When he's unable to find a couch to sleep on, he will walk all night to stay awake and then sleep in local parks during the safer daylight hours.\n\"It's frightening. I've stayed in post office lobbies that are open 24 hours because its warm,\" he said.\nFormerly homeless nonprofit participant James Hayes, 30, can relate. He became homeless at 18 when he aged out of a group home. But now he has a stable place to live, a job, is taking college courses and still attending meetings with other participants in the program.\nHayes credits Babitzke and her supportive nonprofit with helping him succeed.\n\"If you don't have support in your life, it's very hard to be in this situation and move forward,\" Hayes said. \"We're like somebody's second parent, helping them navigate rental agreements and things like that. We help people get back on their feet.\"\nFormerly homeless participant Sam Laidig, 21, agreed.\n\"We're like a connector, an operator. AHO exists more for people to access resources,\" Laidig said.\nAfter going to college for a year and dropping out, Laidig said he became homeless after experiencing conflicts with his parents.\n\"I have pretty severe depression that can give me anxiety attacks,\" Laidig said. \"It killed my motivation to do anything.\"\nAfter couch surfing for many months, the nonprofit helped him find a place to live, paying for the first few months of rent. It's been 18 months since then and he now has a job.\nWhile the San Rafael program is still in its fledgling stages, Babitzke said the hope is the team will help the nonprofit reach an additional 200 new participants each year beyond the 150 people the nonprofit serves on an ongoing basis for up to five years.\nSupport group participant Lindsay Rucker, 28, said she knows what it's like to be young, lost and not have any support. The precariously housed Rucker said the nonprofit's networking services and social support system have helped her greatly   and she hopes it can help others.\n\"It does help me strengthen my own confidence and ways to get around in this world,\" Rucker said.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

We've been working really hard, and to finally have something that proves how hard we've been working feels pretty great.\"\nDrake, which already owned a come-from-behind thriller over Tam, had a great shot of its own to take this one.

Keely Mairs' 3-pointer pulled Drake to within 38-35 with 21.4 seconds left, but that was its only field goal of the fourth quarter. Birnbaum, who picked up three first-quarter fouls in her third game back from injury, had just two points before fouling out.\n\"The game was definitely still there to win,\" Pirates coach Jim Purkey said. \"We have to have our guns (Ali and Lily).

But Tuesday the court denied the request.\nNone of the judges of the Appeals Court requested a vote on whether to rehear the case. Lunny's next legal move is unknown at this point.\nLunny was seeking a temporary injunction from the court to allow him to continue to operate until his lawsuit challenging the closure can be heard. Until legal issues are cleared up, the Inverness oyster farm remains open.\nThe closure order came on Nov. 29, 2012, when Salazar announced he would allow a 40-year lease   originally negotiated with the Johnson Oyster Co. in 1972 and taken on by Drakes Bay   to expire. In 1972, the federal government bought the land from Johnson for $79,200 and provided the lease. Lunny took over the lease in 2004.\nSalazar wrote in his decision that Lunny was explicitly informed \"no new permit will be issued\" after the 2012 expiration date.\nThis story will be updated.\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Kevin Lunny looks out at his workers processing oysters as his son Sean pushes a hand truck full of oysters at Drakes Bay Oyster company in Point Reyes National Seashore, Calif.

Hikers with dogs, and all equestrians and bicyclists, will not be allowed to venture off roads and trails.\nThe department said its revised plan will outline a public process it will employ to designate the official road and trail system. Under the program, existing roads and trails that do not become part of the designated system will be closed as time allows. In the meantime, only \"pedestrians\" will be permitted to use them.\n\"During the public process related to designation of the road and trail system, the retention of redundant roads and trails may be considered to separate trail users,\" the department added. The old plan indicated \"redundant\" routes were destined for closure.\nIn addition, the new policy recognizes \"social trails\" as separate from the designated system of trails and describes circumstances under which they may continue, according to the brief overview released by parks officials.\nThe plan, its provisions and revisions will be reviewed by the Marin County Parks and Open Space Commission at 2:30 p.m. Jan. 23 at the Civic Center.\nOther changes include:\n* Plans that in some cases called for a \"ratio\" program doubling or accelerating trail closures in regions where new trails are created have been dropped. \"As part of the public process to designate the future road and trail system, each existing road and trail will be assigned a score,\" according to the parks department. \"Among other input, these scores will help inform whether a road or trail becomes part of the designated system and, if so, whether a road or trail will be improved, converted, or rerouted to reduce its impact. If a trail does not become part of the designated system, it will be decommissioned.\"\n* The number of \"visitor zones\" set up by the plan was reduced, and the zones renamed. The new names: Conservation area, a designation covering 73 percent of all open space acreage; sensitive resource area, 16 percent of all open space acreage; and impacted area, or 11 percent of all open space acreage.\nWhile key revisions will be released Thursday via the web posting, other revisions including those to improve clarity will appear in a version of the plan scheduled for release this spring.\nFollowing a firestorm of protest and confusion, parks officials pledged to redouble efforts explaining what the draft trails and roads plan does   and doesn't do.\nThe plan makes protection of the environment a top priority while posing restrictions that include shutting wayward trails and old roads. It envisions a network of official paths and restricts activities including off-leash dogs, off-trail jaunts and mountain bike racing.\nBecause there are many \"redundant\" trails crisscrossing 16,000 acres of county parkland, some eventually may be shut following public review.\n\"It is a draft plan,\" Supervisor Steve Kinsey noted last month. \"We're paying attention and we'll make changes.\"\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

Similar high-pressure zones pop up all the time during most winters, but they usually break down, allowing rain to get through to California. This one, ominously, has anchored itself for 13 months, since December 2012, making it unprecedented in modern weather records, leaving researchers scratching their heads. \n\"It's like the Sierra   a mountain range just sitting off the West Coast   only bigger,\" said Bob Benjamin, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Monterey. \"This ridge is sort of a mountain in the atmosphere. In most years, it comes and goes. This year it came and didn't go.\"\nThe current high-pressure ridge is even stronger and more persistent than a similar ridge that parked over the Pacific Ocean during the 1976-77 drought, one of the driest in the 20th century.\nThe result was a record low 10.68 inches of rain in 2013 at Lake Lagunitas, where the Marin Municipal Water District   which has data dating to 1879   keeps its official weather gauge. The previous record low in Marin was set in 1929 when 19.06 inches of rain fell. The annual average is 52 inches per year.\nScientists know that changes in temperature cause high- and low-pressure zones around the world. In many ways, air works like water. The deeper you swim in the ocean, the stronger the water pressure, because the weight of the water above is pressing down on the water below. Air in the atmosphere also has weight, and as temperatures of the ocean and land fluctuate, the atmospheric pressure also changes, helping drive much of our weather.\nWhat researchers don't know, however, is why the current high-pressure ridge is so persistent, or when it is going away, allowing California to enjoy some much-needed rain. A few scientists say that it may be related to climate change, but nobody knows for sure.\n\"I wish I had a really good answer for this,\" said Daniel Cayan, an oceanographer and atmospheric scientist with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. \"It's unusual for the pattern to have not broken down to allow some relatively active, vigorous winter storm systems to track across California.\"\nWith each passing week, California's lack of rainfall becomes more serious.\nLast year was the driest calendar year in recorded history in California in most cities, with records going back 160 years. The first snowpack reading in the Sierra Nevada earlier this month found a snowpack of just 20 percent of normal.\nMeanwhile, Marin Municipal Water District reservoirs are 55 percent full; normally they are 77 percent at this time. Major reservoirs in Shasta and Oroville are each 36 percent full, about half of normal for this time of year. San Luis Reservoir near Los Banos is 30 percent full, 42 percent of normal. Major Bay Area water agencies haven't yet called for mandatory summer water restrictions but are expected to make the decision in the next month or two, depending largely on whether the high-pressure ridge breaks down and rain falls.\nState Department of Water Resources Director Mark Cowin told members of the California State Board of Food and Agriculture in Sacramento a week ago that his agency is likely to recommend that Gov. Jerry Brown declare a drought by Feb. 1, which would make it easier for water transfers between agencies and for emergency loans and other assistance.\nOn Monday at a news conference in Fresno, Brown told reporters, \"It's coming. Just be patient.''\nStill, he said last week: \"Governors can't make it rain.\"\nSince July 1, Marin has received 3.79 inches of rain   just 16 percent of normal; San Francisco has received 2.1 inches of rain, or 20 percent of normal; San Jose has received 1.57 inches, or 26 percent of normal; and Oakland has received 2.08 inches, or 22 percent of normal.\nAll is not lost. Experts note that California still has another two or three months left in its winter season.\n\"In California, most of our water in the reservoirs comes from just a handful of big storms each winter,\" said Daniel Swain, a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University in the Department of Environmental Earth System Science who coined the term \"Ridiculously Resilient Ridge\" on his blog,weatherwest.com .\n\"If we do manage to get a few decent storms, we could definitely get enough water to stave off the worst consequences of a really extreme water shortage,\" he said. \"But if we don't, we've essentially lost the whole water year.\"\nFor anyone concocting plans to set up giant fans or other schemes to get rid of the ridge, meteorologists say that's impossible. The energy in weather systems is greater than the energy in nuclear bombs, they remind us.\nFor at least the next week, the National Weather Service forecasts a few occasional sprinkles but no major storms and no breakdown in the ridge.\n\"We've had a few weather systems come through,\" said Leslie Wanek, a meteorologist in Salt Lake City at the regional headquarters of the National Weather Service. \"But it just keeps rebuilding there. It's kind of a mystery about why. Why is the global atmospheric pattern stuck like this?\"\nIJ reporter Mark Prado contributed to this report.\nfire weather\nA red flag warning is in effect in the North Bay through Thursday morning as a combination of factors including low humidity increases fire danger.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Andrew Bowman carries his bicycle around a closed gate at Sky Oaks Ranger Station on Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2014, near Fairfax, Calif.

Tissue Banks will now move its San Rafael operations to a building in Richmond, which it has purchased.\n\"It's two to three times larger than the building in San Rafael,\" Thrush said.\nTissue Bank's San Rafael facility was one of the largest musculosketal tissue processing centers in Northern California. Thousands of musculosketal tissue donations and corneas were stored there each year.\nTendons, skin, femurs and eyes   gathered from deceased local organ and tissue donors   were dispatched to Tissue Bank's San Rafael location. Their technicians, some of whom are physicians from overseas, prepared the tissues in specially filtered \"clean rooms.\" The tissue was stored in freezers prior to delivery to doctors, hospitals and medical device companies.\nIn its 2012 tax filing, Tissue Banks reported $45.6 million in total revenue and an excess of revenue over expenses of about $1 million. Thrush said the company has more than 200 employees nationwide. In addition to California, the nonprofit has offices in eight other states. San Rafael was its largest facility.\nSan Rafael City Manager Nancy Mackle said, \"We are always sorry to lose a local business to another city. Our economic development staff works with the chamber to conduct business retention interviews with a sample of businesses each year to identify needs, but most often we hear they are leaving after the decision is made, not before.\"\nRobert Eyler, CEO of the Marin Economic Forum and a professor at Sonoma State University, said, \" I don't think there is any reason to hit the panic button or to think this is a signal of a major out-migration of these type of businesses.\n\"It's just a sign that our commercial space is relatively restricted in terms of breadth,\" he said, \" and when a business like this needs to triple in size it is difficult to find a property to suit their needs in Marin County.\"\nArthur Manseau, the owner of the San Rafael building that Tissue Banks is vacating, said Tissue Banks spent $5 million upgrading the 1980s structure so it could accommodate the nonprofits' formidable electricity needs.\n\"BioMarin could easily move in,\" Manseau said.\nBioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. announced in December that it has signed an agreement to purchase the San Rafael Corporate Center for $116.5 million to accommodate its growth needs.\nContact Richard Halstead via e-mail atrhalstead@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: A Tissue Banks International technician works in one of the organization's clean rooms in San Rafael, Calif. on Thursday, June 30, 2011.

They are trying to raise money for the trip and have set up a fund at the Rosie the Riveter Trust, P.O. Box 71126, Richmond, CA, 94807. Donations should specify that they are for the trip to Washington D.C.\nGould calls it all \"a bit of a fairy tale,\" referring to the personal phone call from Biden and his invitation.\nCertainly, it's a long way from the grueling hours she spent working as a welder at the Kaiser shipyards in 1942.\nGould and other women were recruited because the United States needed workers to help build ships. They were breaking males-only union rules and, for a short time, needed to be escorted by chaperones to and from their jobs.\nGould stayed on the job until V-J Day ended the war in August 1945. She \"retired\" from the shipyards and returned home, where she raised five children.\nGould's trip to Washington, she says, will be recognition for the many women who worked in defense jobs. \"Everybody was doing something,\" she said of the war effort.\nThe 1942 poster showed a woman wearing a red polka-dot bandana and rolling up the sleeves of her blue overalls with the printed message, \"We Can Do It!\" The poster was a rallying cry, and has become a symbol for the women who took \"men's\" jobs working in shipyards, munitions plants and aircraft factories across the country.\nThe women, many of them housewives and mothers, proved they could do it. There should never have been any doubt, but before 1942, there was. Gould and her co-workers proved them wrong. They not only helped the U.S. turn back military aggression that threatened the world; they paved the way for generations of women.\nIn 2000, a historical park was created in Richmond, the site of four Kaiser shipyards, to honor Rosies and other homefront defense workers during World War II.\nBiden's invitation is further recognition of that vital military and social contribution Gould and her co-workers made to our nation, its defense and prosperity.\nThe invitation and recognition is a fitting tribute to their hard work and extraordinary service.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: World War II defense worker Phyllis Gould, 92, of Fairfax, volunteers as a docent at the Rosie the Riveter Visitors Center in Richmond, Calif., on Friday, Nov. 1, 2013.

But for 90 minutes last Tuesday, the former special education teacher wasn't defined by her medical condition.\n\"I was a dancer instead of a person with Parkinson's,\" says Byrnes, 62, of Santa Venetia who attended her first dance class for people who have the slow, progressive degenerative neurological disease. \"They treated me with dignity.\"\nByrnes' experience isn't the main focus of the Parkinson's Dance Project, the free drop-in class, offered every first, third and fifth Tuesday by Marin Dance Theatre in San Rafael. The class is structured to get those with Parkinson's moving   essential to help improve balance and flexibility, strengthen muscles and boost coordination. But there is no denying that the classes bring a certain amount of levity and connection to those with the disease, as well as their caregivers, who often feel isolated. \n\"I see a fantastic sense of community and a safe space for them to extend themselves and take risk with movement. I see a lot of joy and enthusiasm and smiles,\" says Torri Campbell, a clinical psychologist and former professional dancer who helped start the program three years ago and co-teaches with Brigid Hoag, a dance teacher with MDT.\n\"People who are diagnosed with Parkinson's often end up focusing on their symptoms, their disease, their medical appointments, and we really want to create a place where they can come and be dancers,\" she says.\nLast week, a group of about 20   students, spouses and caregivers   gathered in the auditorium at St. Vincent's, some like Byrnes for the first time. Classes begin with gentle, warm-up exercises and stretches while sitting that everyone can do, no matter how far along their disease is and whether they're in a wheelchair or not. Campbell talks them through movements   \"Try to find the freedom in your spine.\" \"Be careful and slow.\"   while Rob Ellis plays soft tunes on the piano.\nAbout 40 minutes into the class, Ellis picks up the pace on the piano and almost everyone is standing and dancing. Close to the end of the class, Campbell and Hoag stop giving directions and let the students free dance or dance in pairs.\n\"Sometimes spouses dance together. They never get an opportunity to do that, so there's a lot of joy around that,\" says Campbell, who lives in San Rafael and also teaches movement to seniors at the Redwoods in Mill Valley and family dance at Luna Dance Institute in Marin City.\nA few years ago, she attended a talk by Mark Morris, creator of the Mark Morris Dance Group, in which he mentioned the Dance for Parkinson's Disease program his group founded in 2001. She immediately flew to Brooklyn, N.Y., where the modern dance company is based, to be trained. She convinced MDT artistic director Margaret Swarthout that the program would be a good fit for the 18-year-old dance school.\n\"It's been really special,\" Swarthout says. \"It's been such a wonderful thing for us to do and to be able to use our medium of dance. It's an opportunity for us to give back.\"\nDon Errante, 78, a retired pediatrician who lives in Larkspur, has been going to the classes since the beginning. His wife of 29 years, Lois, began joining him two years ago when he could no longer drive himself.\n\"A lot of people with Parkinson's, motivation is a big problem, and they're not motivated to do these things unless they're in a group,\" Lois Errante, 75, says.\nThe class helps her as much as it benefits her husband, one of the nearly 1 million Americans with the disease.\n\"I've gotten to meet more people, people who are fun to be with, and see how they're doing. It's a tough disease,\" she says.\n\"I'm just in awe of what the dancers in this class come up with,\" says Hoag of San Rafael. \"We offer them a different way of expressing themselves.

He is looking to bounce back and go further this year.\n\"I'm really hoping to get that MCAL title,\" he said. \"Then I just want to keep working hard, do the best I can, be NCS champ and place at state.\"\nMorris credits his father for his success.\n\"He's not just constantly pushing me,\" Morris said. \"But what he does do is provide me every opportunity to get better.\"\nIt was his father who drove him to Stanford twice a week during the off-season for camps after all.\n\"Nathan has spent a lot of time in a car,\" coach Morris said. \"Wrestling is a sport where if you put in the work, you get better. Nathan has always put in the work and he's starting to see what comes of it.\"\nThen there's the fellow senior Berreman.\nBerreman is much more of a renaissance man.\nHe is very much a strong wrestler   he and Morris have even traveled to Okinawa, Japan together to attend wrestling clinics   but that's only part of who he is.\nBerreman also swims and plays water polo at Redwood while taking seven classes in his final semester, playing in the jazz band, and has recently turned in his paperwork to become a full fledged eagle scout.\n\"Music, scouting, sports and doing well in school are all really important to me,\" he said.\nOne thing is for sure, with a workload like that, he has certainly become a master of time management.\n\"It's kind of hard, but I've always found a way to make it work,\" he said. \"This year has been especially hard for me. Some seniors decide to take it easier but I personally decided to make it harder.\n\"There have definitely been times when my parents worry about me, worry I'm doing too much. I always find a way. I realize I could be a lot better at something if I were to drop everything else, but I just want to do it all.\"\nBerreman is a smart, thoughtful and kind young man which is exactly what his coach finds so fascinating.\n\"He's the kind of guy that always has a smile on his face,\" coach Morris said. \"He's pretty aggressive on the mat, which always makes me laugh because he's such a nice guy.\n\"But you know what, he gives it his all. He never asks any questions he just does whatever we need him to do.\"\nBerreman credits his fellow senior wrestler with driving him to become better on the mat.\n\"(Nathan) gives me something to work towards,\" said Berreman, who wrestles at 160s. \"He's someone who is a college-level wrestler, and you can definitely tell. He's much better than me and that's just huge motivation.\"\nMorris has definitely appreciated what Berreman brought to the team.\n\"When my brother graduated I thought I was going to be alone at higher level tournaments,\" he said. \"It's been nice to have Kenneth with me at all of them.\"\nThe bottom line is, both athletes conveyed that they have thoroughly enjoyed their high school experiences and that while ready for the next step, they will miss Redwood.\n\"(Redwood) has provided a really unique experience,\" Morris said. \"It's helped give me all the opportunities to get better.\"\nWhile Morris has dedicated himself to wrestling and Berreman has tasted many slices of life, both come together to lead the wrestling team.

He scored inside and out, drilling a combined seven 3-pointers during that stretch and even rising up for a dunk at home against the Red-tailed Hawks. \n* What he said: \"We played a really strong preseason schedule and had a losing record coming into league. It was tough not winning a lot of games early but it definitely helps us down the line. I was shooting well from the 3s this week, trying to attack and get open and feed my teammates, too.

operating out of an office to close its doors.\nThe collective Caregiver Compassion Group, which closed Jan. 6, has been flying beneath the radar since moving into the office at 15 Woodland Ave. in 2011, after losing its lease in Sausalito. The San Rafael City Council adopted an ordinance in 1997 that states, \"A medical marijuana dispensary is not an allowable use within any district of the city.\"\nTwo Sonoma County residents, Berta Bollinger and Donald Hatt, are co-presidents of Caregiver Compassion Group, a not-for-profit organization and medical cannabis collective with about 300 mostly Marin members. \n\"We've been medical cannabis patients for a number of years,\" Bollinger said. \"We saw how it turned our lives around medically and have decided this is a viable and important thing that we are doing.\n\"We would like to continue doing it in the broad daylight instead of feeling like we're criminals,\" she said. \"It's 2014, for God's sake. The law has been in effect since 1996, and we still can't figure this out?\"\nThe law Bollinger is referring to is Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, which legalized the use of marijuana in California for medical purposes. The initiative passed with a 55 percent majority vote.\nSeveral Marin residents who were getting their cannabis via the Caregiver Compassion Group have written letters to the council asking it to lift its ban. San Rafael Mayor Gary Phillips could not be reached for comment.\nPeter of Eliaser of Novato wrote that he is a quadriplegic who uses medical marijuana to seek relief from spasms caused by his chronic, progressive multiple sclerosis. Eliaser wrote that \"the medical cannabis helps relieve the suffering. The city of San Rafael should allow for patients' bona fide use of medical cannabis, and consider rethinking their position in this matter.\"\nAnother Marin County resident, Mitch Stein, wrote, \"I used to require significant pain medication for my condition, but can now alleviate my pain with a few puffs of marijuana in vapor form or a few bites of a cookie obtained legally from the good people at CCG.\"\nStein did not provide any detail regarding his medical condition.\nSan Rafael police Lt. Dan Fink said following \"some community complaints,\" he assigned his plain-clothes street crimes team to check out Compassionate Caregiver's San Rafael office.\nBollinger said in October a plain-clothes officer came to the office and tried to join the collective using a medical cannabis card issued by a physician whose license had been revoked.\n\"We wouldn't let him in,\" Bollinger said. \"About 10 minutes later, he came back with a whole contingency of other officers.\"\nFink, however, denied trying to run a sting on the delivery service.\n\"We sent one person in plain clothes to ask about purchasing marijuana,\" Fink said. \"He didn't have a card. He simply asked, 'What's the procedure?'\"\nFink said the undercover officer was admitted to an antechamber, but the officer never gained entry to the main office so Fink doesn't know if there was any cannabis on the premises.\n\"I can tell you when we were there talking to them there was an extremely strong smell of marijuana outside the gates of their business,\" Fink said. \"I don't know if that is because they were smoking it in there or if they had product in there.\"\nFink said his undercover officer was told \"they would sell to him there with a card or they would also do delivery.\"\nBollinger said, \"No medicine was on-site here at the office. This was just to keep our computers going, punch in the sales, that kind of stuff. The medicine was coming from someplace else.\"\nBollinger said, however, that people would come to the office to sign up for the collective.\n\"We also did counseling here,\" she said. \"It was place for people to come for feedback, information and support, but not to get medicine.\"\nAt one time there were at least half a dozen medical marijuana collectives dispensing cannabis out of Marin County storefronts. Following a crackdown by federal prosecutors in 2011, however, only one remains: Marin Holistic Solutions in Corte Madera. Corte Madera officials have indicated they will not allow Marin Holistic Solutions to continue operations after its lease expires later this summer.\nIt would appear, however, that Compassionate Caregiver Group may be just one of many medical marijuana delivery services operating in Marin.\nThe websiteWeedmaps.com provides a list of seven from which to choose: Deta Delivery, Green Beauties, Garden Gateway, SVO Outreach, Remedies Xpress, Greenlight Alternatives and Goddess Deliveries.

We came on real strong and showed we're contenders. For us it all starts on the defensive end.

It is a lovely place we all enjoy, but often my daughters are filled with fear. We have witnessed individuals conducting drug transactions, defecating on the pathway where we walk, spreading of trash, and many other activities that take away our experience in this lovely place.\nI was shocked to find out the lack of concern the authorities actually had for our local open space and the safety of our neighborhoods.\nAt one point during a meeting I attended, a homeowner mentioned the high number of thefts from garages and yards as well as cars being broken into were directly related to the problem in the marsh. This was confirmed during a community clean-up day when trash recovered in one of the encampments was papers from a local nearby resident, bicycle parts, drug paraphernalia, trash and a wide array of other items.\nThanks to Corte Madera Public Works, much of the trash was hauled away, but the police failed to patrol or take the advice of local residents who frequent the area.\nNow it is time for the Central Marin Police Authority to take action by making the marsh safe for us all.\nIt has taken another fire, overtime paid to police and fire officials and the closure of the marsh for days to highlight a problem that was commonly known.\nWalter Weis, Corte Madera\nCalming traffic\nMarin could try to slow traffic down with speed bumps, humps, lumps, dips or rumble strips. These \"sleeping policemen\" are universally hated. Motorists thump over them, then aggressively accelerate, annoying neighbors. Bicyclists topple over from any surface irregularity. High-speed driving defines emergency responders who reflexively oppose them.\nSpeed tables are less jarring at neighborhood speeds. Long, sloped ramps buttress a center crosswalk for pedestrians. With sidewalk bumpouts to narrow crossing distance, elderly pedestrians have a fighting chance.\nThey are not inexpensive, but cheaper than roundabouts or lawsuits from crosswalk casualties. Speed tables ensure drivers will slow down, if not stop for pedestrians.\nFew drivers drive slowly outside their own neighborhood, because roads are designed for speeding. Psychological traffic calming approaches slow traffic by creating driver uncertainty through deconstructing conventional traffic engineering.\nEnforcement of speed limits by police patrol is prohibitively expensive, yet arbitrary, sporadic and basically ineffective.\nEngineering solutions are always on duty, but psychological traffic calming and education are more affordable and effective.\nOr safer speeds for every condition could be wirelessly enforced through engine computers from road signs.\nStephen Simac, Stinson Beach", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 14"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Most of Marin County's pharmacies reported Monday that they were temporarily out of influenza vaccine following several days of heavy demand.\n\"What we're seeing is that they're having trouble keeping up with the demand,\" said Dr. Matt Willis, Marin County's public health officer. \"There was a lot of interest in the vaccine over the last few days.\"\nLate last week, two deaths linked to influenza were reported in Marin, and deaths were also reported in Contra Costa, Santa Clara, Kern and Sacramento counties. On Monday, two more deaths were reported in Santa Clara, one in Sonoma and one in San Mateo counties. \nThe predominant influenza virus nationally and in Marin this season is influenza A H1N1, commonly known as swine flu. When the swine flu strain first emerged in 2009, it led to a global pandemic and resulted in the deaths of five Marin residents younger than 65. Influenza deaths are not reported in people aged 65 or older. It's been determined that at least seven of the Bay Area influenza victims this season died after contracting swine flu.\nIn 2009, swine flu distinguished itself from existing seasonal strains at the time by proving to be somewhat more serious in young adults who were otherwise healthy. Normally, influenza hits the very young and the elderly the hardest.\nOne of Marin's two fatalities this season was an otherwise healthy, 48-year-old woman. A flu victim in Sonoma County was 23 and had no apparent underlying health problems. During the 2009-10 flu season, it is estimated that swine flu caused the deaths of 284,000 people worldwide, including 657 Californians.\nAn informal survey by the Independent Journal on Monday morning found that only seven out of 27 Marin pharmacies had flu vaccine available. Four out of five of the Rite Aid pharmacies contacted said they had at least some vaccine left, as did the Target store in Novato, the Pharmaca Integrative Pharmacy in Mill Valley and Passport Health in San Rafael.\nNone of nine CVS, four Walgreens or four Safeway pharmacies reported vaccine available Monday morning, although the Safeway in Novato said it expected to get an additional supply later in the afternoon.\nAshley Flower, a spokeswoman for Rite Aid, said, \"It's just a very fluid situation. We're watching it closely. We're able to reallocate the vaccine from one area to another. So we're just keeping a close eye on that and adjusting as we need to.\"\nMike DeAngelis, a CVS spokesman, said, \"It is possible that individual locations may experience sporadic shortages of flu vaccine based on demand, and we make every effort to resupply any pharmacy or clinic that runs out of vaccine as quickly as possible.\"\nMost of the pharmacies contacted said they ran out of vaccine over the weekend, but a few said they ran out on Thursday and Friday. Many said they expected a new shipment on Tuesday. Some, however, said they weren't sure when they would receive more vaccine. One pharmacy said it expected its next allotment to be relatively small, no more than a few dozen doses.\nWillis said, \"The community is aware of the risks of not being vaccinated and are going to pharmacies and their medical providers in record numbers.\"\nWillis said one of the commercial pharmacies told him it saw a 1,200 percent increase in demand for the vaccine over the weekend, administering 800 vaccinations in a 24-hour period at its Marin County outlets. He said the business, which did not want to be identified, told him it ran out of vaccine Sunday afternoon and had nothing left on Monday.\n\"Some of the larger retail chains are out of vaccine today but are expecting more vaccine tomorrow,\" Willis said.\nJoe Fragola, a spokesman for Kaiser Permanente Northern California, said, \"Last week, we experienced some isolated shortages of vaccine, and moved available supplies between our facilities to meet demand.\"\nBut Fragola said, \"We aren't aware of any spot shortages in Marin.\"\nWillis said state officials have assured him that \"this is not a problem of net vaccine supply so much as an issue of trying to keep up with distribution to areas like ours where there is a lot of demand for vaccine over a short period of time.\"\nWillis said the county still has a supply of vaccine and is ensuring that Marin health clinics serving the disadvantaged have what they need.\n\"We just gave the Marin Community Clinics another 150 doses today,\" he said.\nThanks to the county of Marin, free vaccinations were administered to 70 people on Saturday at Whistlestop in San Rafael.\nContact Richard Halstead via e-mail atrhalstead@marinij.com", "author": "By Richard Halstead", "title": "Most Marin pharmacies out of flu vaccine, new shipments expected soon"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "EVERY WEEK for the past two years I have used the crosswalk to cross Fifth Avenue and D Street from San Rafael City Hall to the Police Annex on the south side of D Street.\nI make this journey several times a day. Most of the time I am wearing my uniform. I do not take it for granted that the sight of a uniformed police officer stepping off the curb to cross the street will have any effect on the actions of the drivers traveling on Fifth Avenue.\nIt often does not. \nDrivers are talking on their cellphones, texting, staring straight ahead (almost refusing to make eye contact) and lost in their own world. This intersection is often used by the trainers of Guide Dogs for the Blind.\nI cringe each time I see a volunteer and their dog step into the roadway.\nAs the leader of the San Rafael Police Department, it is my responsibility to protect everyone in San Rafael. The protection of life, and the safety of everyone in our community, is the central goal of any professional law enforcement officer; however, we cannot be everywhere all of the time.\nOur crime prevention efforts are mostly focused in areas where crime is most likely to occur.\nFor the past two years, we have deployed two motorcycle traffic officers, after having no traffic officers for a time.\nOur traffic officers alone are not enough to keep our streets safe. We need the assistance of everyone in our community to make this a safer environment for all.\nThe number of fatal auto/ pedestrian accidents in San Rafael in the past two-year period should cause all of us to pause and consider what we can do to make our community safer. We experienced no homicides in the past two years, yet five pedestrians were struck and killed by motor vehicles during that same time frame.\nPlease do not think I equate the unlawful killing of another human being with what is often cited as a traffic accident. However, the end result is the same: someone has lost their life. In addition, in the case of a fatal automobile versus pedestrian accident, the driver of the vehicle is left with significant scars.\nThe loved ones, friends and greater community associated with those struck and killed will never be the same. Their loved one has been taken away because of a terrible accident.\nAn accident is an event that is not planned or intended: an event that occurs by chance. Someone loses their life by chance?\nThat is not acceptable.\nI often see pedestrians step into a crosswalk radiating an attitude of \"I have the right of way, so all vehicles will surely stop for me.\" Although they are legally correct, that legal right of way will never prevail against 4,000 pounds of steel.\nBoth drivers and pedestrians bear full responsibility for their actions. We are seemingly always in a hurry. We are important. The rules don't apply to us. We are sure that if we don't make eye contact with the person in the crosswalk, then the next driver will surely slow and stop for them.\nWe are always in a hurry. We never seem to have time for the little courtesies.\nI would ask everyone who is in such a hurry to talk to one of my officers or chaplains after they have spent several hours with a driver who has just fatally struck a pedestrian. That driver will never be the same. That moment will stay forever in their memory. Their tears and regret will not bring the person back to life. It is final.\nIt only takes a few seconds to change one's life forever.\nAs we start the New Year, we must all do our part and recognize that we are all responsible for our actions and for the safety of our fellow citizens.\nNo text message, no meeting, and no distraction are as important as the life of a fellow human being.\nBe safe San Rafael.\nDiana Bishop is the police chief of San Rafael.

Jefferson was standing at a bus platform on the west side of the terminal when the gunman approached from Tamalpais Avenue and fired his gun, police said.\nJefferson, then 22 years old, staggered across the transit center and collapsed near a cement bench, where he was helped by an off-duty paramedic and a private security officer.\nThe gunman got into a gold sedan and was last seen racing down Second Street toward Highway 101. San Rafael investigators identified the suspect as Dean and tracked down the car, which contained ammunition that matched the shooting, according to the prosecution.\nDean was arrested about two months later after police received a tip that he was at a friend's home in New Orleans.\nThe prosecution has not specified a motive for the attack. Dean's defense attorney, Stephen Shaiken, does not dispute that Dean was at the transit center but said his mother, Kaiser Alexander, is a transient who lives nearby.\nShaiken also told jurors that witnesses have offered conflicting statements about the shooting, including which direction the attacker came from.\n\"There is great discrepancies as to everything,\" he said.\nThe trial resumes Wednesday before Judge Terrence Boren in Marin Superior Court.\nDean's criminal history includes charges for a home invasion robbery in Solano County and the robberies of pedestrians in Marin City.\nContact Gary Klien via email atgklien@marinij.com orhttps://twitter.com/GaryKlien\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Ladrakeous Sonny Dean, left, is wanted on suspicion of attempted murder for a shooting Friday at the San Rafael Transit Center, police said.

My daughter's closet, that is   the closet that was the source of so many ignored parental demands to clean up the mess, get rid of the junk and vacuum the floor. My now college-freshman daughter's closet was waist-deep in old clothes, toys, papers, shoes, costumes and dust.\nMy daughter is a slob, except now she is a slob in a college dorm some 3,000 miles away from Mom and her room-cleaning demands. The first free weekend after we had flown across the country to deliver her to school, I got my trash bags and set to work. The sorting plan was simple: a pile to keep, a pile to Goodwill and the rest to the dump. But, oh, the memories that came flooding back as I dug through the closet layers. \nThe backpacks   I start with her high school canvas bag, but then soon find her middle school black-with-cherries backpack that we had special ordered during her everything-cherries phase. Finally, I find her purple grade-school backpack, with the \"friends\" and rainbow patches neatly sewn on. Along with the backpacks, I found the fake-fur Indian medicine bag I had sewn for her, age 4 or 5, after we read a story about Sacagawea. I told her the bag was made from lynx fur and she carried it for a long time, filled with feathers, a real snakeskin and assorted rocks and shells.\nThe closet held so many old shoes, but it was the pretty white flats that brought back memories of shoe shopping on a hot summer day in Paris   and the sore feet and ice cream afterward.\nI found her Brownie Girl Scout vest, with its badges for friendship and sports, and thought of the generous mom who made time to be her troupe leader. And I found the small pink tent that my daughter set up in our living room for months at a time as her home away from home when she needed her own private place to read and sleep. There were so many costumes, and I carefully hung up the wizard robe with the long silver sleeves, made for Halloween at her specific request during her Harry Potter period, and the Little Red Riding Hood dress and cape.\nI threw away the old math homework, the lonely socks and the single Barbie shoes. But I carefully rolled up the growth chart, with the dates and heights carefully marked, each one representing a happy \"look how much you've grown\" moment of pride. And, so much more.\nI got to the bottom, swept up the debris and vacuumed the floor. I made neat piles and carefully placed the \"keep\" pile back in the closet, orderly now.\nWhen my daughter comes home for the holidays, she will not like the order. She may have to toss some clothes around, just for old time's sake. Just to make her mom remember where she's been.\nCarolyn M. Jones is a San Rafael resident.

Here's a list of goals that Marin town and county governments should pursue in 2014.\n1. Conduct an origin-and-destination study of residents in every Marin apartment complex with more than 25 units. Include a modality question to determine the means of travel, whether it's auto, transit, bicycle or walking, for all their trips.\nThe regional alphabet agencies' claims about environmental benefits of building high-density housing near transit routes are faith based. There are no North Bay studies to show what means of travel are actually used by residents of large-scale housing. \nHow much better to make those potentially community-changing decisions with actual facts? Any study must be conducted by a neutral data-compiler who lets the results speak for themselves.\n2. Provide public employee retiree health insurance only when employees reach 65 years of age.\nRetiree health care insurance costs are consuming an evermore-substantial portion of Marin municipal budgets. The bulk of those unsustainable costs are incurred between the time the employee retires from government service and when they reach age 65.\nFor police and fire personnel retirement can be as early as age 50.\nA good many of those now-retired employees go on to jobs in the private sector that also provide health insurance.\nIf 65 is the starting date, retirees can participate in Medicare, with a supplemental policy paid by the government for which they last worked as retirement benefit.\nFairness dictates this reform should apply only to new employees.\n3. Each city, fire district and the county should be required to prepare a wildland fire safety report card. The effort would determine which agencies and their residents are following best practices to make certain that they are protected from the greatest threat to life and property in Marin: wildland fire.\nThe results should not only include evacuation procedures after a wildland fire starts. It needs to disclose if communities are doing everything possible to assure that a small brush or house fire doesn't spin out of control, morphing into a community-destroying disaster.\nGrade these agencies on the curve so we learn which jurisdictions are outstanding and which need to shape up.\n4. Pursue functional consolidations of sewage districts. It's now politically impossible to rationally merge Marin's nine independent and two city-controlled sewage districts into one agency. The next best approach, locally pioneered by some school districts, is called functional consolidation.\nThat method retains independent sanitary districts with their elected boards but their professional staff is shared among all agencies. There's no reason that maintenance work and front-office functions can't all be performed by one central professionally managed staff.\nThe functional duplication that's now the norm is expensive. It inevitably results in an inconsistent level of service and repair.\nFunctional consolidation is fiscally and operationally efficient while retaining district-level control. The only excuse not to pursue this reform is that veteran elected sewage commissioners will cry \"we've never done it that way.\"\n5. Require restaurants and institutional food outlets to post a Marin County hygiene grade at each establishment's entrance. New York City mandated this reform years ago, complete with an A-to-F grading system. It's time allegedly progressive Marin followed suit.\nCurrently, Marin County's Environmental Health Services' hygiene reports for restaurants are posted online without any rating. Realistically, no one enters a caf\u00c8 and goes online to check sanitary reports.\nCounty supervisors need to buck Marin's 1,400 food purveyors, some of whom understandably prefer that their patrons don't see a negative cleanliness grade posted on their front door.\nColumnist Dick Spotswood of Mill Valley now shares his views on local politics twice weekly in the IJ.

This is the eighth report by the JNC and the first in more than 10 years.\nThe biggest change in JNC8 was the level of blood pressure that should be treated with medications in people older than 60. Blood pressure is always measured as the peak pressure (systolic) over the basal pressure (diastolic). Both the systolic and diastolic pressures are important, and both have thresholds for treatment. Previously the treatment threshold had been set at 140/90 and those with sustained blood pressure over that level would have been considered for treatment with medications. \nJNC 8, however, increased the threshold for starting therapy in otherwise healthy adults older than 60 to 150/90, 10 points higher on the systolic pressure than the previous recommendations. The new guideline also suggests that if medications are required, the goal for otherwise healthy, older adults is a systolic blood pressure under 150 rather than under 140.\nThese new recommendations do not apply if patients with high blood pressure also have diabetes or kidney disease. These people are considered higher risk, and the old standard of 140/90 is still the goal. The lower blood pressure goal also applies to younger patients (younger than 60) with high blood pressure.\nThe new JNC8 guideline is based on the findings from multiple medical studies that have questioned the benefit of aggressive blood pressure lowering in otherwise healthy adults older than 60. Even though high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure and death, no real benefit was seen in lowering systolic blood pressure to 140 rather than 150. On the other hand, keeping diastolic blood pressure under 90 has been shown to be of significant benefit for patients regardless of risk factors or age.\nPeople with diabetes or kidney disease are particularly susceptible to the effects of high blood pressure so it makes sense that the lower threshold of 140/90 stills applies to them.\nThis new guideline does not mean that if you are taking blood pressure medication and you are doing well with readings in 130/80 range that you should stop or cut back on your medication. Well-controlled patients should continue their medication unless directed otherwise by their doctor.\nBut for patients with newly diagnosed high blood pressure, it makes sense to wait a while and give lifestyle changes a chance. Cutting down on salt and alcohol, starting an exercise program and losing weight are all effective measures for lowering blood pressure. If the systolic blood pressure is hovering in the mid-140s, there is no urgency to start a medication right away. And for those with higher blood pressures that require medications, treating to get the upper number under 150 is sufficient (if you are 60 or older and don't have diabetes or chronic kidney disease).\nThere are other changes in the JNC8 guideline, including recommendations on which medications should be used as initial therapy.\nThe big change, however, is the treatment threshold. Raising the systolic threshold from 140 to 150 means that thousands if not hundreds of thousands of patients with borderline blood pressure may be able to avoid drug therapy. It is also important to realize that the blood pressure numbers are just that   numbers. They are part of an overall risk picture for any individual. In general, the lower the bloods pressure the better. Those who are blessed with naturally low blood pressure are at very low risk from cardiovascular disease.\nFor the rest of us, we should do everything we can to naturally lower our blood pressure with a healthy lifestyle that includes eating a healthy diet, daily activity, avoiding excess alcohol and salt, and reducing stress.\nDr. Bill Elliott is an internist at Kaiser Novato and an assistant clinical professor of medicine at UCSF.

Every property with a dedicated irrigation meter has an annual allocation of water. That allocation is then budgeted, at the owner's request, for use on a monthly basis throughout the year.\nA mandatory 50 percent reduction of that annual irrigation allocation should be implemented now to conserve water for domestic use, rather than waiting until April.\nWill there be landscape losses?\nFor sure.\nBut Marin also has some of the state's best landscape contractors, certified irrigation managers, and Qualified Water Efficiency Landscape-certificated managers and irrigation techs.\nOwners can, and should, seek out these professionals to implement their drought action plan strategies and minimize landscape loss.\nRichard Reasoner, Stinson Beach\nSupport local business\nI'd like to thank Novato council members for their support Tuesday night in considering and including the Novato Horse and Pet Supply store in the design guidelines of the North Redwood Boulevard Corridor.\nLaurie Lucchesi and her family are equally appreciative.\nWe all know commerce is vitally important to any city and recognizing one business at the expense of another is counterproductive.\nSo as the development of the Redwood Corridor moves forward, I hope that all the residents in Novato who depend and do business with Nero's firewood will continue to do so, and that Nero's receives the same consideration as Novato Horse and Pet Supply store for its location in the corridor, or elsewhere.\nTrish Boorstein, Novato\n'Another consultant'\nI was not surprised to read in yesterday's IJ that the Marin Board of Supervisors has hired another consultant for $37,000, this time \"to survey the work force, find out what people think about their jobs, colleagues and managers and fully assess performance in the organization, manager and employee domains.\"\nI suspect the supervisors may even have a consultant to advise them the best choice in the cafeteria for lunch every day.\nThe supervisors consistently use consultants to do the work that one expects the staff to complete.\nWhat did surprise me was a survey completed in 2012 found \"only about half of the 1,289 employees questioned reported having confidence in senior management's leadership.\"\nWe need better leadership from county supervisors and senior managers, and certainly the 2012 survey finding explains how such a massive failure like the $35 million (or more, given likely staff time and inefficiencies) computer system fiasco occurred.\nThis massive waste of tax dollars directly resulted from poor planning and judgment by senior staff and the Marin supervisors using very expensive consultants that sold them a system not suitable for Marin that has now been scrapped and is being replaced.\nNeed I mention they have hired yet another consultant to decide on a new computer system?\nIt is time to institute term limits and vote in new Marin supervisors that will properly represent their constituents in a fiscally responsible manner.\nBob Ratto, Novato", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 13"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "An East Bay resident who came to Marin City to sell about three pounds of marijuana Friday night told sheriff's deputies he was robbed at gunpoint of the marijuana. \nThe Marin County Sheriff's Office got a call from a resident on Terners Drive in Marin City at 7:23 p.m. saying a man was at his door asking for help, according to Marin County sheriff's Lt.

Rising to its crest requires hiking steep sections of fire road that provide a good workout and the reward is panoramic views. \nQueenstone Fire Road provides access to the east end of Big Rock Ridge Open Space. I prefer to do this hike as an out-and-back, so I can turn around any time and return via the same route. It's 1.6 miles up the Queenstone Fire Road to the crest of the ridge. The ascent is a steady uphill challenge as the fire road gains 1,200 feet in elevation.\nBegin the hike at the Open Space gate on Queenstone Drive in the Marinwood neighborhood of San Rafael. The uphill grade starts immediately and so do the views. To the east are the marshlands along San Pablo Bay near China Camp State Park. Las Gallinas Creek is the waterway along the Santa Venetia neighborhood and San Pedro Mountain is the forest-covered ridge towering above it.\nOak, madrone, manzanita and toyon trees line the road. Many of the madrone trees still have clusters of berries that normally ripen in December. Marin's lack of rain has withered some of the berries and that may impact wildlife that depend on the berries for winter food.\nThe eastern end of Big Rock Ridge is so narrow that the homes in Novato's Pacheco Valle are visible on one side of the fire road and houses in Marinwood can be seen on the other side.\nI'm accustomed to seeing layers of wispy white fog or thick clouds settle into low areas, but the recent blue-brown haze has tainted the scene a bit. Winter is usually a time of crisp clear air.\nLike everyone else, I hope rain will come in sufficient quantity to cleanse the air, quench the thirst of the dry landscape and fill our reservoirs. Until then, visitors to Big Rock Ridge will have to try and identify landscape features through the haze. Looking south, the distinctive line of eucalyptus trees on a long hill mark San Rafael Ridge and the prominent round grassy knob is Bald Hill standing above San Anselmo. Mount Tamalpais' profile is visible as a long sloping silhouette.\nAt the junction of the fire roads, veer left onto Big Rock Ridge Fire Road and walk as far as you wish. Return by retracing your steps back down the Queenstone Fire Road.\nTo reach Queenstone Fire Road, leave Highway 101 at the Marinwood exit and drive west on Miller Creek Road. Turn right on Queenstone Drive.\nTacy Dunham is the author of several trail guide books. For more information about her books, emailcottonwoodpress4ca@hotmail.com .

As fighting has escalated, some 14,000 Iraqis have sought refuge elsewhere, but Al-Kubaisi's parents, five sisters and 9-year-old brother have remained hunkered down in their home.\n\"The situation for my family has been very dangerous for two weeks now,\" he said through an interpreter from his bed in an Alameda County rehabilitation hospital, where he is being treated for bed sores and infections from lying on his back for as long as eight months at a time. \"My family is under siege and can't leave the house because it's so terrible outside. They have no groceries or things they need. There are air raids by the Iraqi military against militant targets, but at the same time a lot of innocent people have died. I worry about my family more now than ever.\" \nA good-looking young man with a ready smile and an unruly corona of dark, curly hair, Al-Kubaisi arrived in the Bay Area in July from Jordan under the sponsorship of the Hayward-based Alalusi Foundation, a nonprofit charitable organization that has helped resettle as many as 50 Iraqi refugees and their families.\n\"His personality and positive attitude helps him stay alive,\" said Hesham Alalusi, the foundation's president and founder. \"Psychologically, somebody else would be in despair and wither away. But this guy is alive and open and looking forward. He's always looking forward.\"\nAl-Kubaisi doesn't yet speak English. But, through a translator, his harrowing story is being recorded by the Marin-based Citizens Reach Out as part of its \"What Happened?\" project, an archive of interviews documenting the accounts of Iraqi refugees displaced as a result of the 2003 U.S. invasion.\nOn Jan. 16, Citizens Reach Out is hosting a benefit for him at the Seahorse Restaurant in Sausalito. The money will help pay for a new wheelchair and a special bed that his supporters hope will allow him to live on his own.\n\"He gives us the opportunity to do something tangible, to actually help somebody,\" said Ruth Friend of Citizens Reach Out. \"And the second thing is that he gives us the opportunity, through him, to talk about what happened to millions of people. He's the vessel. He made it out somehow, and I don't understand how he did it. It must have been sheer will.\"\nAl-Kubaisi recounted what happened to him in heartbreaking detail in documents submitted to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the agency that referred him for urgent resettlement in the U.S.\nHe was a 16-year-old high school student on June 3, 2007, the day his life almost ended. He describes it as \"a normal day\" in Fallujah, a city that had been devastated by two of the bloodiest battles of the Iraq War. \"Normal,\" in this case, is relative. The day before, a friend of his was shot in the head and killed by an American sniper.\nBut he wasn't thinking that would happen to him when he ventured out of his family house in an alley near an American military base to walk to a neighborhood market.\n\"As I was heading across the street, all of a sudden I heard a shot,\" he remembered. \"I fell to the ground in the middle of the street, but did not lose consciousness. I saw that I was bleeding and felt a lot of pain.\"\nThe bullet, his doctors later determined, had been fired by an American sniper. It hit him in the back, blasted through his spine and exited his chest.\n\"People did not want to come into the street to help me at first because they were afraid that someone would shoot them as well,\" he told the UNHCR. \"An older man who lived nearby eventually carried a white flag out into the street and came over to help me. Four or five younger men followed him and helped carry me to a car.\"\nThey drove him to a local medical center for emergency treatment, trying to staunch his internal bleeding. He was then shuttled around to hospitals in Baghdad before being taken back to a hospital in Fallujah.\n\"The doctors thought I would die because my blood was so low,\" he said. At yet another hospital, an MRI confirmed that he was paralyzed from the chest down, able to move only his head and arms.\nAfter 28 days, he was sent home, but the heat at that time of year contributed to his wounds becoming infected. His family exhausted its financial resources taking him to Jordan for further treatment and physical therapy. After eight months, he and his family were forced to return to Iraq.\nOnce settled back in Fallujah, a friend pushed Al-Kubaisi in his wheelchair to an American military base, where he told an officer in charge what had happened to him.\n\"My family spent a lot of money on the medical help I needed, so I went to the military base to ask for compensation, or even to assist me to get out of Iraq to receive the appropriate medical treatment,\" he said from his hospital bed in San Leandro. \"In the early stages of my treatment, it would have helped a lot. But they didn't assist me in any way. They said we're sorry. We shot you by accident, and that was it. We can't compensate you for anything.\"\nThe IJ contacted Army Public Affairs for comment, but had not heard back by press time.\nBecause he had gone to the American base, suspicions arose in his neighborhood that he was supporting the U.S. cause. As a result, his family got the first of several death threats. One was a letter with a bullet in it, another was a DVD showing the slaughter of U.S. and Iraqi soldiers. It was signed by an Al-Qaida organization that had taken over their neighborhood.\n\"I was very depressed and the city was so violent that I was unable to do anything out of fear of being hurt,\" he said. In October 2011, he fled to Jordan, where he sought help from the UNHCR, the refugee organization that aided in resettling him in the Bay Area.\nOne of his interpreters, Farah Al-Mousawi, a 29-year-old Iraqi living in San Rafael, brought him the book \"English the American Way,\" to help him learn how to communicate in his new country. Under his bed is a ukulele from another new friend teaching him how to play it in exchange for lessons in Arabic.\n\"I had heard about the American people's friendliness and kindness, how they would reach out a hand to a person who needs help,\" he said with a smile. \"That's something I realized even before coming to America.\"\nUnderstandably, he harbors some resentment against the American military for what it did to him and his country.\n\"I was at the time of my life when I was enjoying normal teenage years with my friends and family,\" he said, \"and all that was taken away from me. \"\nBut he is not one to dwell too much on what he's lost, preferring to look at better days ahead.\n\"I'm hoping that I can continue on here in America with the goals I had before I was injured,\" he said, noting that he would like to study to become a pharmacist. More than anything else, though, he thinks about the family he left behind.\n\"It really pains me to be away from them, to be separated from them for this long,\" he said. \"I'm new in America, and I don't know the ropes, how to make it happen, but my wish is to be reunited with my family here in America, where it's safe, and not a war zone like in Iraq.\"\nContact Paul Liberatore via email atliberatore@marinij.com ; follow him on Twitter athttp://twitter.com/LibLarge .

It would phase in over five years beginning in the 2015-16 school year and could cost the state $1 billion annually when fully implemented   adding an estimated 350,000 children to public schools. \nProponents argue those costs would be offset by savings later on. They point to studies showing that preschool prepares children for school, resulting in fewer being held back to repeat a year, lowered numbers in costly special-education classes, and fewer students failing in school and ending up in prison.\nThe state already funds preschool for certain 4-year-olds   those just missing the cutoff date to start kindergarten because they have birthdays toward the end of the year. SB 837 would order school districts and charter schools to make that class, known as transitional kindergarten, available to all 4-year-olds.\n\"Expanding transitional kindergarten for all 4-year-olds is the unfinished business of last year's important school reform,\" which revamped the state's school funding formula, said Sen. Darrell Steinberg, the author of SB 837. He called it the Democrats' No. 1 priority this year.\nBut Marin education officials aren't clear on whether the bill intends to make preschool available to all 4-year-olds or simply enroll even younger children in transitional kindergarten. Each comes with its own set of standards and requirements.\nPeggy Dodge, early childhood education professor at College of Marin, said there are many problems with the transitional kindergarten model of education for 4-year-olds.\n\"We agree it's time for that investment in children's years before school, but feel the vehicle is so wrong,\" Dodge said. \"It's just another grade of elementary school.\"\nIn preschool, Dodge said there is one adult for every eight children. This would change to one adult for every 20 children under the transitional kindergarten model. In addition, it would require those teaching younger children to obtain multi-subject teaching credentials, allowing people who are used to teaching 5th grade to teach young children without any special training.\n\"If it becomes another grade of school, it rules out people who've been trained in early childhood education and are the current work force. There could be a huge job loss,\" Dodge said.\nAmy Reisch, executive director of First 5 Marin, agreed that it's unclear exactly what the teaching standards would be under SB 837.\n\"There is some discussion among people in the field about whether what we're really talking about is transitional kindergarten or preschool,\" Reisch said. \"I think most of the field is very excited about the emphasis on closing the achievement gap and providing more opportunity.\"\nFirst 5 Marin is an independent government agency that guides the use of Proposition 10 funds for children up to 5 years old in Marin. Reisch said the whole First 5 Marin commission has yet to discuss the proposal, which was announced last week, but that more funding for additional education would be great.\n\"Any infusion of resources into the early care and childhood education system in this state is desperately needed and much appreciated,\" Reisch said.\nMichael Watenpaugh, superintendent of San Rafael City Schools, said he's in favor of the idea, but hopes the proposal will include more funding for schools.\n\"I certainly believe we need to have children in school as soon as possible, particularly given the new Common Core Standards and lack of available preschool in Marin,\" Watenpaugh said. \"However, it does present a facilities challenge. We've grow significantly over the last six years and have little classroom space.\"\nIf the bill picks up support from influential teachers unions and education advocates like the state PTA and the school boards association, California would join only a handful of states   Georgia, Oklahoma and Florida   with universal preschool. The bill already has the support of state superintendent of schools Tom Torlakson. But it's far from certain that Gov. Jerry Brown, who proposed defunding transitional kindergarten in its first year, would sign it.\nEspecially since he has already called for spending $11 billion   or more than 10 percent of the total budget   to pay down $24.9 billion in remaining debts the state racked up during the previous decade. More than half of that money would be used to repay public schools, whose state aid payments were slashed by as much as 20 percent in recent years to balance the budget. In addition, the general fund budget includes $45.2 billion for K-12 schools, an increase of nearly $4 billion from the current fiscal year.\nSB 837, known as the Kindergarten Readiness Act, would phase in an expanded transitional kindergarten program, currently available to children who turned 5 from Oct. 2 to Dec. 2. The proposed bill, meanwhile, would make children whose birthdays fall from Sept. 2 to Feb. 1 in the 2015-16 school year eligible for transitional kindergarten.\nIn each of the following three years, the bill would expand the window of eligibility   based on children's birthdays   by two months.\nIn the final year of the phase-in, all children who turn 5 during the 2019-20 school year would be eligible to enroll in transitional kindergarten. Potentially, California could need 8,000 additional teachers and 12,000 classroom aides.\nThe bill estimates the cost per student at $6,000; the average state cost of for a K-12 student is $9,000.\nContact Marin Independent Journal reporter Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter atTwitter.com/hansenmegan .

When I'd come back for summers I'd work at the San Rafael Community Center as associate director of their sports camps. I've done extensive volunteer work at things like the Pebble Beach Pro-Am and Pac-10   as it was back then   women's basketball championships. I've always kept one foot in the door to help out at major events, and I've always wanted to be a part of putting on these really massive events that tens of thousands of people can enjoy.\"\nImbimbo will follow in the footsteps of the late John Cardinale who died in March of gastric cancer. Cardinale was senior director of media and community relations, along with the title of track vice president. Cardinale was an innovator in crafting clever media events and spearheaded the track's astounding growth in local charitable causes.\n\"We've raised over $4.5 million for Speedway Children's Charities for Sonoma County's youth-oriented organizations; incredible, incredible organizations that we give money to,\" Imbimbo said.\nBut it's not about just handing out checks and hoping for the best. Imbimbo and other trustees of SCC vet all applications for grants. And they follow up face to face.\n\"Each of us does at least one site visit to an organization that we either funded or didn't fund so we can learn more about the organization and what they do and where the money goes,\" she said.\nThis is perhaps the most tangible part of carrying on the Cardinale legacy.\n\"His integrity, his diligence, his abilities as a leader in getting everybody motivated; I'm so glad that we were able to work so extensively together since 2006 so I was able to mold myself after him,\" Imbimbo said.\nWhereas that side of her duties is very fulfilling, the other side is challenging. The Bay Area sports media is very stick-and-ball oriented, and getting the print, radio and TV media to give racing its proper weight can be difficult. So media event enticements have to be unique.\n\"We've done cooking demonstrations with Jeff Gordon. We've taken Tony Stewart to train an elephant at the zoo. We've taken three Daytona 500 winners on cable car tours around San Francisco,\" Imbimbo said. \"I'm very involved not only with the media outreach on those events but the planning from signage to location scouting.\"\nAnd through that she's come to know the sport's heroes.\n\"To work with people like Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, and Jimmie Johnson in different media events has been an incredible part of my job; to know that they are good people as well as incredible athletes,\" she said.\nLooking towards the track's future, progress comes from innovative ideas. Last year was the first running of the NASCAR Express, a dedicated train straight to the track from Sacramento and the Central Valley. But along with improvement through grand ideas, there's also refinement through small details.\n\"I attend 49er games as a fan, and I always come back to our marketing and fan experience meetings with, 'Okay, this is what I saw, this is what I liked, this is what I didn't,'\" Imbimbo said. \"It is so important for us to get into the mind of the everyday fan.\"\nThat analytical approach and her passion for sports make Imbimbo a great asset to the coming era of the raceway.\n\"There is no one I trust to oversee a project more than (Imbimbo),\" Brennan said. \"She is able to run with a project from start to finish   both seeing the larger end goal and the minute details to get there. Whether it's overseeing a successful food drive or setting up for a race weekend, she is able to put together a solid plan and see it through to the end. Jen is good at her job because she brings a true passion for people and an incredible work ethic to everything she does.\"\nBeing one of the premier racing facilities on the continent gives Sonoma Raceway something very vital: the power to help.\n\"I think that success for the raceway is not only about our bottom line but making a positive impact in our community, whether it's through our Speedway Children's Charities, food drives, blood drives, toy drives, or children's Christmas parties,\" Imbimbo said.\nRacing is about adrenaline, and Imbimbo has one goal in maximizing that: \"Make sure our fans come out here and have an amazing, unforgettable time.\"\nPit bits\n* Lap times at the Roar Before the 24 testing at Daytona again proved that Novato's Memo Gidley has a legitimate shot at the biggest win of his career. The Corvette Daytona Prototype he will share with Alex Gurney, Jon Fogarty, and Darren Law placed fourth overall over the three days of testing.\n* Kevin Buckler's TRG Aston Martin Racing squad will field a pair of Aston Martin V12 Vantage GT3's in the GT Daytona class. The Novato resident's cars ran mid-pack in a class of 28 cars in the 58-car field.\n* Corte Madera's Tom Dyer also drove a top-10 car at the test, the Pickett Racing P2 Nissan ORECA. He isn't likely to race in the Daytona 24 on Jan. 25-26, though. Dyer was right on the pace of the other three drivers, and hopes to parlay that performance into drives with this or other teams at that level later in the year.\n*\nAfter winning in class at last year's 24 Hours of Dubai, San Rafael's Vic Rice tasted the agony of defeat on Saturday. The Lotus Evora Rice shared with three other drivers only turned 23 laps, finishing second to last in the 77-car field.\nTodd Telford covers motor sports for the IJ.

If you do that, you won't need supplements. That's what I recommend,\" a longtime San Rafael pediatrician and author of \"The Marin County Diet\" told the audience at his book signing event Sunday afternoon.\nAn engaged and eclectic group of about 35 nutritionists, medical professionals and parents showed up at Book Passage in Corte Madera to hear Dr. Albert Goldberg, the former medical director and nutrition advisor of Head Start in Marin from 1967 to 1972, discuss his latest book. The doctor did add that those over 60 would be best advised to take multivitamins. \nAlso in the group was the Larkspur resident's 4-year-old granddaughter Allyson, exhibiting considerable vim and vigor as she scampered around the room. Since the book, subtitled \"Feed your children right from birth,\" is a guide to optimal diets for healthy children, it would appear that Goldberg's son Louis and daughter-in-law Xuejun are succeeding with the program.\nThe book is called \"The Marin County Diet\" because Marin \"is a very healthy place to live,\" the doctor said, adding, \"By 'diet,' I did not mean weight loss. It's a nutrition book, not a weight loss book.\"\nGoldberg, who began practicing in Marin in 1967 and retired three years ago, said some foods believed to be healthful are in fact the opposite.\n\"In the past few years, Marin school administrators decided to replace sodas loaded with fructose and sugar in the schools. And what did they replace it with? Fruit juice, including orange juice,\" Goldberg said, to groans from the audience.\n\"What's wrong with orange juice? You take all the sugar in an orange and leave out the pulp, and the sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream too quickly. The pulp slows down the absorption of sugar,\" Goldberg said. \"A lot of people are making recommendations without having an understanding of the chemistry of the body.\"\nThe doctor also discussed the glycemic index. This index is a numerical scale indicating how fast and how high a particular food can raise a person's blood sugar level.\n\"The glycemic index is explained in the book. Few people eat things like bananas and watermelon alone. They eat them in combination with other foods. This changes the speed of absorption, so the foods may not cause blood sugar to rise as fast as the index suggests,\" Goldberg said. \"The glycemic index may be an interesting guide, but on a practical level, it's not that helpful.\"\nThe lecture was studded with interesting factoids, including, \"Babies are born with a taste for sugar. Breast milk is loaded with sugar,\" the doctor said. This is healthy because the sugar in breast milk is not isolated, but comes with a combination of protein and fat, he said. Breast milk is also high in cholesterol, which babies need for brain growth, the doctor said.\nOn the other hand, \"the taste for salt is not innate. It develops around four months of age.\n\"When a child is sick, every mother wants to give them chicken soup. However, if you look on the can, there are thousands of milligrams of sodium in every can,\" said Goldberg, who recommended making chicken soup from scratch.\nGoldberg served for 47 years on the pediatric staff of Marin General Hospital, and was as an adjunct clinical professor at the UCSF School of Nursing.\n\"For me, what is helpful is knowing the science behind these things,\" said Veronica Valero, a mother from Novato who came to the event. \"The biggest challenge I have a single parent is having the time to prepare wholesome, tasty fare for my son.\"\nAshley Wallace of Rohnert Park, who is five months pregnant, came to the event with her mom, Lee Ann Baxter-Lowe of Novato.\n\"It was interesting,\" Wallace said. \"When I was growing up, people didn't know as much about nutrition.\n\"I definitely want to go with a natural diet,\" Wallace said. \"I do it for myself, and I want to do it for my child.\"\nContact Janis Mara via email atjmara@marinij.com .

Pruning and preparing plants for spring growth is an important part of winter gardening and pays dividends later.\nRoses can be a thorny contradiction, however. While they are simple, beautiful and perhaps as old as gardening itself, roses are also complicated, bred into many thousands of hybrids and cultivars. It all can be intimidating to a beginning gardener. \nThe history and classification of the genus Rosa is a bit messy and difficult to grasp, which is perhaps part of the intrigue that prompts some gardeners to become rosarians, join rose societies and devote valuable time and resources to their acquisition and cultivation.\nThe kind of rose, however, does make a difference in how it should be pruned. Rather than try to fathom the Rosa genetic tree, let's instead get down to the basics so that prickly bush in your yard can be efficiently pruned with some degree of confidence.\nFirst off, the gardener should be prepared with clean and sharp pruners, loppers and some good gloves. The modified epidermal cells that we erroneously call thorns are a real menace and the wounds they inflict have a tendency to become infected. A good pair of leather gloves, or even some longer gauntlet gloves, are reasonable protection from these dangerous prickles.\nSecondly, the concept of the grafted plant should be understood. There are many old garden and species roses that are \"on their own roots,\" but most modern roses are growing on a rootstock from a different plant. The bud or graft union, if present, needs to be identified and any canes arising from the rootstock eliminated. Not doing so will weaken the grafted variety and in time overtake it. The union is usually a callused swollen area just above the crown of the plant.\nBecause roses are so valued and complex, the plants often will have labels. So keep them if you have them. The type of rose can then be easily looked up and any special needs addressed. If a label is found, hallelujah! Clean or replace the label, and be sure it is attached to a strong cane to be kept.\nAs with any woody plant, the gardener will start pruning on \"the three Ds\": the dead, the diseased and the damaged. Just removing these, along with any suckers from the rootstock, will sometimes simplify a complicated bush or vine. The next things to prune are parts of the plant displaying any of the natural enemies of the rose, such as fungal pathogens such as rust, powdery mildew and black spot.\nThe goal of the rose pruning is to create a situation in which future growth will maximize sunlight penetration and airflow throughout the plant. With this goal in mind, remove any crossing branches and make clean, angled cuts \u00ba-inch above desired outwardly facing buds on remaining canes to create an airy and symmetrical shape.\nTiming and sanitation should also be kept in mind. Pruning should be timed for late winter season or early spring. Sometime in January is usually best. If pruned too early, a plant might respond with new growth only to have it damaged by a hard frost. All old leaves on the plant or the ground should be removed as they can harbor fungal organisms. Likewise, take care not to injure the canes and anvil-type pruners should not be used.\nWhile these procedures will get the job done, there are plenty of exceptions. For instance, an old garden roses (bred before 1867) that only bloom on old wood are best pruned just after bloom. These would include damasks, mosses, gallicas and albas. Also, some species roses and modern ground cover or carpet roses can be pruned with much less precision, simply shaping them to their desired form. Additionally, new roses should be allowed to establish their roots before a hard pruning and most climbers should be trained where desired and their laterals pruned back to two or three buds.\nIf you are interested in learning more about roses, visit the Marin Rose Society's website atwww.marinrose.org . Information on rose diseases and abiotic disorders can be found on the University of California Integrated Pest Management roses webpage at http://bit.ly/1bOYq6v.\nFor some great hands-on rose pruning experience and advice, join the Master Gardeners and master rosarian Lenore Ruckman for a demonstration and talk on Jan. 11 at the Falkirk Cultural Center in San Rafael.\nThe University of California Marin Master Gardeners are sponsored by UC Cooperative Extension.

Chino, 28, launched the project for the iPad, and iPhone and Android smartphones while working full time as director of sales operations for San Rafael-based technology company Qube Learning and completing his master's degree in business administration at Dominican University in San Rafael. He lives with his girlfriend in San Anselmo. \nQ: You grew up in Arcata, where your parents own three restaurants. Did you work in the restaurants?\nA: I was a busboy at Plaza Grill throughout high school.\nQ: Why develop a game around an excavator? Wouldn't a tank be more marketable?\nA: I definitely thought about that. At the same time, there are a whole lot of people in that space already. We know we're in a niche market, but there is just an insane amount of worldwide interest in construction stuff, particularly excavators.\nQ: You charge $1.99 for the game; how is it selling?\nA: We don't give out specific download numbers. But I can say that about 80 percent of mobile games, free and paid, will never see 10,000 downloads, and we achieved that on both Android and the Apple platform within the first five weeks.\nQ: Are you profitable?\nA: We passed the break-even point about a month ago.\nQ: Who wrote the code for the game?\nA: We designed everything and then the programming was done in Pakistan.\nQ: Was the game expensive to develop?\nA: What was expensive were the accelerometer controls. When we started the project, we didn't know if simulated digging would even be possible on mobile devices. Digging is so computationally heavy that a lot of the devices' processors can't handle it. There are other excavator games in the marketplace. Most of them do not have digging. So what is the point of even having an excavator?\nQ: I understand you got the idea for the game by operating an excavator that belongs to your girlfriend's grandfather.\nA: The first time I got to operate it, her grandpa, Fred, said, \"Here's how the controls work. I'll be back in 20 minutes.\" He left me to dig up a bunch of stumps. I think he was gone closer to 40 minutes, but it seemed like five minutes. It's pretty intense when you're trying to memorize all the controls and you're shaking and rocking a 25-ton machine. It's pretty scary.\nQ: Where do you go from here?\nA: I'd love to be making a lot more games. It's a really fun process. It's really labor intensive though, especially in the testing phase. When we're in testing mode, no one is sleeping at all. You'll take a nap between two and three in the morning, get a new iteration and just keep going.\nContact Richard Halstead via e-mail atrhalstead@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Mobile games developer Andrew Chino holds his smartphone as he poses for a portrait in Fairfax, Calif. on Saturday, Dec. 21, 2013.

And it wasn't a particularly festive crowd, milling around quietly in their oddly monochromatic attire. Winter certainly put its damper on fun.\n\"Hey Jeff, can you please get that guy in the brown hat a seat?\" asked the manager in passing, obviously busy with some other task. I often liken bartending to running a half marathon with someone barking orders at you the whole time. Being a restaurant manager is similar, except that in a bartender's case, more orders means more money and in a manager's case all it means is more gray hair. \nAt any rate, the manager was gone long before I had the chance to tell him that the man in the brown hat had already asked me the same thing. In fact he had also asked the other bartender the same thing, the bar-back, the cocktail waitress, the hostess, the other manager, the food runner and everyone else even remotely associated with the restaurant. In fact, he had even mentioned it to some of the other people waiting.\nI know, because each of them had repeated it to me. And I answered each of them the same way: \"All of the seats are taken. When someone gets up, I'll let him know.\"\n\"They are refusing to seat me,\" said the man in the brown hat to another man, dressed in black, who had actually been waiting longer.\n\"I don't know why they are doing this,\" Mr. Brown Hat told someone else, who neither asked nor cared.\nI call it playing the victim. Life sort of happens to some people. Everything they do is a reaction to some perceived slight. They are convinced that they are always being victimized; the girl at the coffee shop is ignoring them, the mechanic did something to their car, the mailman's losing their mail, the butcher gave them the small cut of meat, all on purpose. It's always something, and it's always being \"done\" to them. It must be exhausting going through life like that. I know it's exhausting from the other side.\n\"Sir, it should just be a minute.\"\n\"You sat that person first,\" he said, jabbing his finger at a person farther down the bar.\n\"You mean the pregnant lady?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"She was here before you, and even if she wasn't ...\" I said, letting the obvious dangle.\n\"They won't seat me,\" he said to a woman in a beautiful sequined black jacket.\nWhen a seat did become available, the man in the brown hat pushed his way directly into it. Thank goodness there were no small children or widows in the way.\n\"That's better,\" he said, sitting down.\nTrust me, it was not a sentiment everyone around him shared.\n\"Can I get something to drink?\" Mr. Brown Hat asked in that accusatory manner that often accompanies victim behavior.\n\"I don't know why they won't serve me,\" he tried to tell the seated gentleman in the black suit just as I was in the process of doing just such.\nDon't let the facts get in the way of your story, I always say.\n\"Nobody can truly believe how bad a day I've had,\" he said to anyone who would listen, which at this point was no one.\nIn the bar business, being at a customer's beck and call can have its drawbacks.\nMr. Brown Hat continued unabated by the subdued response of the small crowd.\nPeople playing the victim need an audience, but not necessarily an attentive audience.\n\"What's with all the black?\" he asked a young lady in an uncharacteristic moment of awareness.\n\"Some of us were at my younger brother's funeral,\" she said, gesturing at the room. \"He was killed in a car accident.\"\nMr. Brown Hat didn't know what to say.\nBut what was there to say? When one spends all his time playing the victim, encountering someone who has suffered real victimization can be uncomfortable, especially if the real victim isn't making a big deal out of it.\n\"Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears,\" wrote Marcus Aurelius in his \"Meditations.\" But then again Aurelius never worked in the bar business.\nJeff Burkhart is the author of \"Twenty Years Behind Bars: The Spirited Adventures of a Real Bartender.\" Follow him atwww.jeffburkhart.net and contact him atjeffb@thebarflyonline.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Jeff Burkhart mixes a drink in a shaker on Thursday, Sept. 6, 2012 in Novato, Calif.

But that's not just an interesting observation   it means we have less water in Marin's reservoirs than we would normally have this time of year.\nWe all need to conserve water by eliminating water waste. \nIt may be hard to believe, but just one year ago our reservoirs were 100 percent full, which was well above average. Today, they are below average and are continuing to drop.\nBecause we rely on our local watershed rainfall for 75 percent of our needs, low rainfall is indeed problematic.\nIn response to this situation, the board of directors of the Marin Municipal Water District recently passed a resolution encouraging water conservation among district customers. The board also directed district staff to take actions necessary to prepare for a dry year and instituted a Resiliency Task Force to address both short-term and long-term water supply issues.\nHopefully, we will receive rain this winter, but we can't operate under the assumption that we will.\nCalendar year 2013 was so dry that it set a new record low for rainfall on the Mount Tamalpais watershed, with less than 11 inches falling over the last 12 months. That's far less than the annual average of 52 inches and well below the previous record low of 19 inches set in 1929. We aren't used to such extreme reductions in rainfall   we've had abundant rainfall and water supplies for more than 20 years now.\nThat means many of us may have gotten complacent when it comes to conserving water. While water-efficient fixtures are the standard today, and you don't need to put a brick in your toilet tank, there are still actions you can take that will make a difference.\nHere are some ways to get started:\n* Turn it off: If you haven't turned off your irrigation system for the winter, now is the time. Even without rain, most plants require little water this time of year because they are dormant. During dry periods, check high-water-use plants for stress and water if needed. Don't forget a blanket of mulch to slow evaporation and protect roots from the cold.\n* Find and fix leaks: Our conservation specialists discover leaks in about one third of the homes they visit   and often the homeowners never suspected. Your water meter can help you monitor your water use and determine if you have a leak; find step-by-step instructions atmarinwater.org .\n* Get a rebate: To help our customers save water and money, MMWD is offering rebates for high-efficiency toilets, high-efficiency clothes washers and smart irrigation controllers. Learn more.\n* Call us. Need help finding ways to save water? We'll send a water conservation expert to your home or business for a free consultation. Call 945-1523 to schedule.\n* See water running down the street? Let us know by emailingconservation@marinwater.org or calling 945-1520.\nBeginning last spring, MMWD took steps to preserve our supply by making changes to our water system operations and enhancing our leak-detection efforts, and we continue to do the same. But we need your help and are asking you to do your part to conserve water.\nIf it rains in the next few months, we'll appreciate it all the more.\nAnd if it doesn't, we will be better prepared to live through a dry period.\nFire control will also be an important consideration in the spring and summer due to the dry winter. Depending on the storage levels on April 1, we may need to call for voluntary 10 percent water use cutbacks or 25 percent mandatory cutbacks.\nThe more water we all save now, the better off we will during the rest of this year and next.\nLarry Russell of Tiburon was the 2013 president of the Marin Municipal Water District Board of Directors and Armando Quintero of San Rafael is the 2014 president.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: A tire lies exposed on dried mud by Stafford Lake in Novato, Calif. on Thursday, Jan. 9, 2014.

This is one of the reasons that four local law firms are donating their time to \"save the farm.\"\nOn July 11, 2012, the state Fish and Game Commission, a state constitutional authority, sent a letter to then-Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar, which said: \"The commission, in the proper exercise of its jurisdiction, supports and continues to support the agricultural business of aquaculture, and to that end, has clearly authorized the shellfish cultivation in Drakes Estero through at least 2029 through the lease granted to Drakes Bay Oyster Company. The commission will continue to regulate and manage oyster cultivation of oysters in Drakes Estero pursuant to state law.\"\nThe letter also said the National Park Service should recognize the cultivation of oysters in Drakes Estero \"as a valuable resource to the public and to the economy of Point Reyes National Seashore.\"\nThe letter clearly details the state's jurisdiction.

Traffic was frequently mentioned. \nOver the past year, traffic jams have worsened, partly due to construction along the Novato Narrows   which when completed should help relieve congestion   and due to more commuters using the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge to return to their East Bay homes. Marin officials are working on reopening the long-closed third lane on the eastbound deck, but there's no promise it is going to occur quickly.\nEvery day, including weekends, we learn that all it takes is a fender-bender or a stalled car, and traffic can go from moving to mired.\nAt the same time, traffic is heavier off the freeway.\nMany Sausalito and Tamalpais Valley residents blame the new traffic signal at Tennessee Valley Road for tying up traffic, particularly on weekends.\nAnd the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit train, although making headway in construction and in acquiring funding, is still almost two years away from rolling, taking commuters from Santa Rosa to Larkspur Landing.\nMike Straus of Mill Valley summed up what a lot of Marin residents are saying: \"I feel like in the last year the traffic on Highway 101 has gotten worse.\"\nCertainly, decision-making over possible improvements didn't get any better. Marin officials worked for much of last year on a plan to improve traffic flow and safety in the Corte Madera-to-Greenbrae stretch of Highway 101. Even though they had money earmarked for the work, they couldn't agree on a plan, other than investing the money into a new multi-million-dollar bike path and helping SMART pay for extending its future service from San Rafael to Larkspur.\nHow either improvement is going to \"fix\" the freeway is debatable, but it certainly sent a message to local residents that consensus on improvements to Highway 101 are hard to come by. There's not much opportunity left for widening the freeway without disrupting existing homes and businesses.\nIf 2013 was any indication, there also is an absence of strong leadership and political consensus and trust on this front. Turning that around should be a goal for members of the Transportation Authority of Marin during 2014.\nSo should efforts to improve local transit. We need to make convenient and affordable alternatives to driving your car to and from work a top public priority. Lately, the trend has been raising prices and trimming service.\nBesides frustrating local residents and workers, traffic is Marin's No. 1 contribution to greenhouse gases. Getting traffic moving instead of worsening pollution-belching gridlock should be a countywide goal.\nThe problem is not going to get any better until community leaders build a long-range plan. That's going to require a strong foundation of trust, leadership and vision. The time for building that is today.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Brakelights come on as Highway 101 southbound traffic grinds to a halt during commute hours on Thursday morning, Nov. 14, 2013, in Novato, Calif.

But the DA now says there is not enough evidence to prosecute Mr. Grayson for assault with a deadly weapon.\nIt stands to reason that if Mr. Grayson did not threaten Deputy Kubota, that then the deputy should answer for firing bullets at Mr. Grayson. I called the DA about his failure to prosecute Kubota, and his chief deputy e-mailed me back \"that no charges were filed against the deputy due to insufficient evidence to prove a criminal violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\nOne would have thought that multiple bullets fired at an unarmed, non-threatening man was sufficient.\nIf Mr. Grayson cannot be prosecuted for threatening a deputy, what justice is there in the deputy not being held accountable for shooting at Mr. Grayson? Had Mr. Grayson been white, would the DA's findings have been different?\nThe deputy's shooting of Grayson and more especially the DA's decisions have outraged many in the African American community and those of us who are white.\nThis has set back all the efforts that Supervisor Kate Sears has been making to repair the hostility between the sheriff's substation and local people.\nThat hostility has been generated by years of discriminatory surveillance and humiliation that have provoked numerous community meetings.\nWhat's to be done? The state Government Code places the responsibility squarely on the Board of Supervisors as representatives of local citizens to supervise the conduct of all county officials, whether they are elected or not.\nThe supervisors also can further call on the DA to allow a jury or grand jury determine whether there is evidence to convict the county deputy of wrongdoing.\nAnd finally, this crisis cries out for the supervisors to form a citizens review and advisory council for the sheriff's department. Even before the DA's decision, nine Marin organizations, including the Marin City Community Services District Board, the county Human Rights Commission and groups representing Marin's Latinos urged the supervisors to create such a council.\nA third of California's counties have such boards that hear citizens' complaints and advice regarding their sheriff's departments and utilize attorneys, often volunteers from the local bar association, to assist them.\nAn independent citizens council is absolutely essential for rebuilding trust between Marin's citizens and the sheriff's department and supervisors.\nAlan Barnett of Mill Valley is a retired university professor and a longtime local activist for civil rights and peace.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Alan Barnett", "author": "By Alan Barnett Guest op-ed column", "title": "Marin Voice: Public deserves facts in Marin City shooting case"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "The question to ask at the World Guitar Show in San Rafael this weekend is not what's new, but what's old?

There's very few places you can do that.\"\nCommanding the highest prices are electric guitars built in the 1950s and '60s. On Saturday, one of the rarest and most expensive was a 1957 Fender Stratocaster with a price tag of $48,500. It was being sold by Oakland-based dealer Jay Rosen, who has about 50 used guitars for sale this weekend.\n\"It's an iconic guitar,\" he said as onlookers admired the sculpted shape of the nearly 60-year-old Strat. \"And it's pretty rare.\"\nBut he had another guitar even older and more rare if not more expensive. He opened a musty case and pulled out a 1950 Fender Broadcaster, the precursor of the popular Fender Telecaster.\n\"It was the first electric guitar the public could buy,\" he explained. \"They only made about 200 of them before they changed the name.\"\nIt wasn't in quite as good a shape as the Stratocaster, or as sought after, so he only wanted $39,000 for it.\nNovato's Dennis Haggerty has been a regular patron of the show, which began in Marin in 1998. But this is the first year he's been an exhibitor, sharing a booth with Novato neighbor Phil Rountree. The coolest item they had for sale wasn't a guitar, but a funky old sweatshirt with a picture of the early Beatles on the front, misspelled as the Beetles.\n\"Spelled correctly, those sweatshirts are $1,000 on eBay,\" Rountree said. \"Spelled incorrectly, they are even rarer.\"\nNevertheless, he would part with it for $1,000. Or less.\n\"I'll go down from there,\" he said.\nNot everyone went to the show looking to buy.

But we battled hard. I have nothing but praise for the girls.\"\nMC, which has lost five of its last six games, has struggled to find any consistency on offense. After her fast start, Langan was held to two free throws the rest of the game. Hannah Politzer, who had a game-high 11 rebounds, scored seven points after drawing a blank in the first half.\nPart of the Wildcats' offensive woes stem from the loss of starting guard Claire Renk, who will miss the entire season after undergoing knee surgery from an injury suffered playing club soccer in September.\nThe Wildcats, however, proved they can still play defense. They held the Braves to four points in the third quarter. Unfortunately for the Wildcats, all their hard work at the defensive end paid no dividends. They scored their first and only points of the third quarter after five minutes of futility on a pair of free throws by Politzer.\n\"We played a pretty tough third quarter,\" DeMartini said. \"We had a lot of good looks on shots that we didn't finish. If we make half of those layups we missed in the third quarter, maybe we make a game of it.\"\nJustin-Siena's Haley Cremen, who came in averaging 19.2 points per game, took it upon herself to snap the Braves' scoring drought and scored nine of her game-high 19 points in the final eight minutes.\n\"We got a little passive after halftime,\" Justin-Siena coach Mike Boles said. \"I thought our defense kept us in the game in third quarter. And then Haley got hot at the end. I think she's the best player in the league, but I'm biased.\"\nAlexis Tye scored six points for the Wildcats and teammate Scout Polizzotti added five points and nine rebounds.\nContact Tim Menicutch via email atsports@marinij.com\nJUSTIN-SIENA 48, MARIN CATHOLIC 29\nMCAL\nJustin-Siena           14           16           4           14                       48\nMC           7           10           2           10                       29\nJustin-Siena  Malloy 4 0-0 11, Moore 2 3-4 8, Irvine 1 1-2 3, Cremen 6 5-9 19, Mallari 1 1-1 3, Castellucci 1 0-0 2, Slinsen 1 0-0 2.

Of course, many of us don't put down our books even when December gets hectic. But January's a good time to rediscover what we loved about books in the first place. This month brings new novels by Tiburon's Tiffany Baker and Bay Area authors Maria Hummel and Kirstin Chen. Also on the list: a new memoir by \"L'Affaire\" author Diane Johnson and a nonfiction work on the importance of reading by Berkeley critic Wendy Lesser.\n* \n\"Mercy Snow\" by Tiffany Baker (336 pages, Grand Central Publishing, $25) Tiburon author Tiffany Baker (\"The Gilly Salt Sisters\") returns with this tale of two New England families. It's the mid-1990s in Titan Falls, N.H., and 19-year-old Mercy Snow has inherited her family's rundown home. Returning to town with her older brother, Zeke, and her younger sister, Hannah, she arrives with good intentions   until a terrible accident sends a school bus skidding off an icy road, killing one of the town's children. Zeke is blamed, and Mercy's quest to clear her brother's name forces her to take on the wealthy McAllisters, the town's ruling family and owners of the local paper mill. As the families' secrets come pouring out, Baker deftly balances personal grievances with broader concerns about pollution, economic justice and corporate responsibility in small-town America. She'll read from the book Jan. 17 at Book Passage in Corte Madera.\n*\n\"Motherland\" by Maria Hummel (384 pages, Counterpoint, $26) Family history fuels \"Motherland.\" Maria Hummel's novel, set in Germany during the waning years of World War II, is a moving story of love and privation, sacrifice and survival. The book's central character is Liesl Kappus, a young wife left to care for three stepsons when her doctor husband, Frank, is drafted as a medical military officer. Liesl's struggles to find food for the children are compounded when two refugee families move in with them; Frank, meanwhile, faces daily horrors in his work as a reconstructive surgeon. Hummel, a Jones Lecturer at Stanford University, delivers an intimate portrait of family life during wartime, one that draws on accounts from her father's German childhood and letters from her paternal grandparents discovered years after the war ended. She'll read from the novel at a book launch party on Jan. 14 at Booksmith in San Francisco.\n*\n\"Soy Sauce for Beginners\" by Kirstin Chen (256 pages, Amazon Publishing/New Harvest, $23) Bay Area author Kirstin Chen explores the East-West divide in this debut novel about a young woman's struggle to reconcile personal goals and family traditions. Her protagonist, Gretchen, is married and living in San Francisco when she discovers that her husband has been unfaithful. Gretchen impulsively packs up and moves back to her native Singapore, only to discover that all is not well in her childhood home; her mother is ill, and her father's soy sauce business is failing. If Gretchen's attempts to rescue the company and revive her love life feel a little predictable, Chen, who was born and raised in Singapore, navigates the culture with the insight of an insider.\n*\n\"Flyover Lives\" by Diane Johnson (264 pages, Viking, $26.95) Diane Johnson has scored hits with her keen observations in three novels, \"L'Affaire,\" \"Le Mariage\" and \"Le Divorce.\" In \"Flyover Lives,\" she turns to the memoir form, considering what it means to be American. It all starts when a French friend drops an offhand remark: \"It's funny,\" she says, \"the way all Americans believe they are descended from royalty.\" That's enough to get Johnson reflecting on her Midwestern roots. She digs into family history, tracking it back to the early American settlers and their pioneering westward journeys, spicing the narrative with a personal account of her own path as a writer. Meet the author Jan. 30 at Mrs. Dalloway's in Berkeley.\n*\n\"Why I Read: The Serious Pleasure of Books\" by Wendy Lesser (240 pages, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $25) Wendy Lesser, founder and editor of Threepenny Review, writes of the delights and rewards of reading in this new book of critical essays, sharing insights about favorite authors and the novels, plays and poetry that have changed her life. \"Reading literature,\" she writes, \"is a way of reaching back to something bigger and older and different. It can give you the feeling that you belong to the past as well as the present, and it can help you realize that your present will someday be someone else's past.\"\n -\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: 'Mercy Snow' by Tiburon author Tiffany Baker handout\nTiburon author Tiffany Baker's new book is 'Mercy Snow.'

In Marin, Mill Valley was one of the communities that embraced the emerging counterculture. Or at least some people did.\nResident rock musicians played in downtown bars at night, thrilling some and annoying others, who complained to the city about noise from amplified music. Young people swam nude in Cascade Dam, raising conservative eyebrows. And everyone was talking about the crazy stuff that was going on at Old Mill School, including students bringing large cardboard refrigerator boxes into the classroom to use as \"study hotels.\"\n\"Oh, those were great times at Old Mill School,\" a smiling Jim Derich, a former open classroom teacher, recalls in a fascinating new documentary by three 17-year-old Tamalpais High School seniors, Hana Dahl, Max Bayer and Paula Venables. \"People from all over wanted to see what the hell was going on here, what was so special.\" \nThe student team created the 12-minute film, titled \"Ol' Mill,\" as an assignment in Tam's Academy of Integrated Humanities and New Media (AIM), a two-year, three-subject program for juniors and seniors that blends required social studies and English courses with hands-on experience in digital video and audio production, web design and other media applications.\nThe filmmakers came to realize that AIM is the kind of progressive educational program that may not have been part of the Tam curriculum had the groundwork not been laid by the crusading teachers who bucked traditional classroom teaching methods at elementary schools like Old Mill.\n\"What is interesting to us is the program we're in, AIM, runs on a similar set of ideas as those of that era,\" said Venables, who plans on going to college to become a teacher. \"You can see how it paved the way for what we do today in AIM. They turn us loose with cameras for six weeks and say, 'Go find a story.'\"\nThe story they found came through Hana Dahl's cello teacher, a longtime resident who was among those in town who were not fans of Old Mill's \"cardboard box era.\"\n\"She was definitely against it,\" Dahl recalled. \"She thought it was a crazy thing that happened.\" She wasn't alone. The documentary points out that one family was so upset they moved to Switzerland.\nIn those revolutionary years, Old Mill was one of the Marin schools leading the way in student-centered alternative education, literally breaking down walls in experimental \"open classrooms.\"\nDeparting from conventional schoolrooms with desks lined up in rows, these were large spaces with teams of teachers overseeing students of different grade levels, ages and abilities. Kids sat on the floor or lounged on couches, played chess, read comic books and were encouraged to learn at their own pace. Homework was optional.\nIt was the cardboard boxes, three-sided affairs decorated by the students to reflect their personalities and interests, that really fueled critics' sense of outrage, thinking they were beyond kooky. From the teachers' perspective, they were intended to promote self-discipline, focus and creativity, giving kids their own private refuge. One boy drew redwood trees inside his.\n\"The husband of one of the parents we interviewed said it would be fine if you're going to live your life in Mill Valley, but if you're not you might want to go to a normal school with a real class,\" Bayer said.\nThe student filmmakers thought the cardboard box thing was pretty laughable themselves until they interviewed Lynda Chittenden, the now retired teacher who spearheaded the open classroom concept at Old Mill.\nIn the film, she describes the changes she and her colleagues instituted as \"visionary,\" recalling how teachers like her believed they could change the world.\n\"She swung us back the other way,\" Venables said. \"We thought, oh my God, this is a real thing. They were serious about trying to make reforms in education.\"\nIn addition to the two teachers, the filmmakers found and interviewed three parents, two former students and one woman who was highly critical of the experiment.\nFor the Tam teens, those interviews were eye-opening in other ways as well, painting a picture of a Mill Valley that was much more down to earth than the wealthy, upscale community they grew up in.\n\"It wasn't such an elitist community then, such a bubble,\" Dahl said. \"The town used to be more middle-class, with regular normal people.\"\nIt was also a haven for writers, artists, musicians, free thinkers and later wealthy hipsters whose hedonistic new age lifestyles were satirized by author Cyra McFadden in the \"The Serial,\" a series in the weekly Pacific Sun that became a book and a movie.\n\"We heard over and over in our interviews that Mill Valley was crawling with hippies, that it was free and easy,\" Venables said.\nShe and her fellow filmmakers may have been most shocked by how independent kids were then. They heard from one of the former open classroom students that there was no such thing as today's \"helicopter parents,\" so-called because they hover over their children, putting pressure on them to succeed.\n\"It was this little paradise where kids went outside and played until it was time to come home for dinner,\" Venables said. \"Parents didn't set up play dates for their kids. I had never heard of that before. How else would I go on a play date? My parents had to set it up for me.\"\nThe filmmakers may have laughed at first about kids in boxes, but it made them think about another kind of box that some high-achieving students find themselves in today.\n\"There's a box-checking mentality among kids in wealthier communities like this,\" Dahl said. \"If you do this and this and this and check all those boxes, then I can get into the best college and be a success. Our joke during this whole thing is that they might have physically put kids in boxes then, but now we put them in boxes metaphorically.\"\nFor a time, conservative forces in Mill Valley pushed back against the changes they felt threatened their peaceful little village in that turbulent era. Cascade Dam was closed in 1972 and later drained, putting an end to skinny-dipping. It seems unbelievable now, with rock bands playing every night at Sweetwater Music Hall and live entertainment flourishing at the 142 Throckmorton Theater, but the City Council actually banned amplified music for a time in the mid '70s.\nAt Old Mill School, the refrigerator boxes lasted only about a year, the students discovered, but many of the open classroom innovations continued on and have been integrated into the mainstream.\n\"As the '60s petered out, these radical educational ideas petered out, too,\" Bayer said. \"But in another sense they still kind of stick around today. You have these specific classes with project modes like AIM and you have AP (Advanced Placement) calculus with desks in a row where you study math. You have a combination of the two rather than one or the other.\"\nContact Paul Liberatore via email atliberatore@marinij.com ; follow him on Twitter athttp://twitter.com/LibLarge .

Novato's Paint the Town Red gala   celebrating the city's 54th birthday   is set for Jan. 24. \nNovato has long celebrated its birthday, but the red-themed gala began about 11 years ago. Around 200 people are expected this year, according to Jennifer Goldfinger, one of the co-chairs of the event. The party is a community partnership between the Citizen of the Year Committee, city of Novato, Novato Chamber of Commerce and School Fuel.\nNovato seniors last week got a taste of things to come as Goldfinger, event co-chair Victoria Crawley and Novato City Councilwoman Jeanne MacLeamy served them white sheet cake with red pastry rosebuds and carrot cake.\n\"You are the heart and soul of Novato, so we wanted to help you help us celebrate Novato's 54th birthday,\" Councilwoman Jeanne MacLeamy told about 40 members of the Senior Citizens Club gathered at the center for lunch.\n\"Since many members of the club won't be able to come to the party, we bring them cake beforehand,\" MacLeamy said afterward. The pre-event is a longstanding tradition for Paint the Town Red.\nSenior Nozer Patel, 74, attacked his cake with alacrity. In addition to the white sheet cake with whipped cream frosting, MacLeamy, Goldfinger and Crawley also handed out slices of carrot cake, which Patel pronounced his favorite.\nAlso featured on gala night is the announcement of Novato's citizen of the year. Last year's winner was longtime Novato volunteer Patty Bennett, whose late husband Chuck won the award in 2001.\nPaint the Town Red will run from 6:30 to 10 p.m. at the Margaret Todd Senior Center, 1560 Hill Road.

Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco were able to get the agency to extend the date to Feb. 18. \n\"There were some of the dog groups that requested an extension,\" said Howard Levitt, park spokesman. \"We have gotten several comments and expect more as we get closer to the new deadline.\nDog supporter Martha Walters of San Rafael said the extension is important to address issue in detail.\n\"I want good science, give me a good, thorough process,\" she said. \"There are 22 areas and only seven allow dogs off leash? It's a set up for failure. They want to take recreation out of the parks. First its dogs, then the horses, then windsurfers and it will go on from there.\"\nThe controversial issue has pitted passionate dog owners against park officials and environmentalists. Dog owners say their dogs need space to run and have started a websitewww.marincountydog.org to support their cause.\nBut there have been complaints lodged with recreation area officials about aggressive dogs attacking people and smaller animals scaring children and trampling on sensitive wildlife habitat.\n\"We are still opposed to dogs running off-leash and disturbing sensitive habit,\" said Barbara Salzman, president of Marin Audubon. \"There are places for dogs to run off leash, like dog parks. Many cities have them.\"\nDuring a comment period on the initial 2011 dog leash document, the park received more than 4,700 comments, a majority from dog lovers who disagreed with it. Because of the comments, and additional data and studies, the supplemental draft was developed.\nIn the \"preferred alternative\" of the older plan, off-leash opportunities were greatly curtailed   and in some cases were banned altogether   on federally managed beaches and trails in Marin, San Francisco and San Mateo counties.\nOne of the changes for Golden Gate National Recreation Area lands in Marin under the new plan is at Muir Beach. Dogs are now allowed off-leash under voice control at the beach. The 2011 plan called for an outright ban, except for the parking lot. The latest plan allows dogs at the beach, but on a leash.\nBut for Muir Beach resident Pam Swarts, that is not an ideal solution.\n\"Dogs need a place to run. Dogs are more sociable and less aggressive off-leash,\" said Swarts, who walks her dogs along the beach. \"The environmentalists and bird lovers are crying foul, but there are miles and miles of open coastline in California for birds, seals, et cetera. Muir Beach should continue to be shared by everyone.\"\nThe long-awaited final ruling   due in late 2015   could set a wide-ranging precedent for dogs in national parks across the country.\n\"We are still on track for a decision next year, even with the extension,\" Levitt said.\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\nRead the plan\nCopies of the dog walking plan can be reviewed athttp://parkplanning.nps.gov/dogplan .", "author": "By Mark Prado", "title": "Comment on controversial Marin GGNRA dog leash plan gets extension"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "A fire in a pile of lumber behind the Travelodge in Mill Valley early Saturday morning was doused within minutes by the Mill Valley Fire Department.\nThe blaze broke out shortly after midnight and was first spotted by a Mill Valley police officer patrolling the Redwood Highway frontage road.

I held back on doing so because, like the bad guy in the old spaghetti westerns, the darn thing just wouldn't roll over and die. It just kept writhing and spewing out yet another \"I'm not ready for the wrecking ball\" epitaph.\nIt probably started when it stood up to the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, and it's been sticking out its figurative tongue at us ever since. \nEven now it clings to life, hoping that some weird combination of wins and losses today will give it yet another encore before the fat lady really does sing.\nAlmost 54 years is not a particularly long lifespan unless you consider that Candlestick Park seemed to be 40 years old when it was built. Much as I didn't believe anything that Richard Nixon said when he was president, so, too, did I not believe him when the then-vice president threw out the first pitch on opening day 1960 and declared, \"This will be one of the most beautiful parks of all time.\"\nI was there on opening day of 1960 as well, selling seat cushions on the walkway behind home plate. I remember saying to Dick Quinlan, my fellow seat hawker that day, a rather different take than Mr. Nixon. My comments went something like, \"What a (expletive) dump.\" Also unlike Mr. Nixon, I had no aspirations to be president.\nIt was no secret, even before the park was built, that Candlestick Point was one of the windiest spots in San Francisco. And, any longtime San Franciscan who was even on the periphery of city politics would tell you that the entire process was a political boondoggle. Charles Harney, the contractor who had the ear of the powers that be, insisted the street leading to the ballpark be named for him, a modest touch I thought.\nAnd yet, in its early incarnation, there was still a certain mom-and-pop shop feel about it. My cushion-selling boss was a troll-like creature who I'm convinced hadn't left the cushion room since Lefty O'Doul played for the San Francisco Seals at Seals Stadium, and only arrived at Candlestick Park in an upside down crate marked \"This end up.\"\nWhen I got into the sports broadcasting business a few years later, the press box and press lunchroom were filled with characters that would have made Damon Runyon jealous. Beer was served all day in the press box and many of the beat writers were adept at timing their consumption with their deadlines. If a game went into extra innings there were a lot of typos in the morning paper.\nThe son of the team's owner would sit in the press box and was always there to answer questions. So long as it was prior to the sixth inning at about which time he would nod off from partaking of the press box offerings.\nLon Simmons   one of my favorite all time people   was calling the games next to the great Russ Hodges, and the announce booth had holes in the metal flooring for ventilation   below which freezing fans would partake of smoking the herbal sustenance now legal in Colorado.\nOne particularly chilly night at the 'Stick, Lon turned to Russ midgame and said, \"I don't know about you Russ, but I feel a lot better now than when I walked in here three hours ago.\"\nI was there when Dwight Clark made the Catch, I was there when Willie McCovey's ninth inning line drive was caught by the Yankee's Bobby Richardson ending the 1962 World Series, and I was there when Juan Marichal threw a two-hit shutout in his first major league appearance. I saw the greatest player to ever don a uniform (in my humble opinion), Willie Mays. I saw Joe Montana and Jerry Rice, Steve Young and Ronnie Lott. I even saw the Beatles there.\nAnd it all wasn't because of Candlestick Park; it was in spite of it.\nA big part of my life will come crashing down when that wrecking ball first hits, but the good news is I get to keep the memories.\nThe better news is, I get to be warm.\nBarry Tompkins is a longtime sports broadcaster who lives in Marin.

But, like me, you'd think wrong.\nThat all changes next weekend when, 43 years after they blew Lone Star minds with Dead-style progressive rock, the Greezy Wheels, recent inductees into the Austin Music Hall of Fame, make their Marin debut in a free afternoon show on Jan. 19 at Rancho Nicasio. \nThe day before, they're happily doing another gratis gig, this one at San Francisco's Jammin on Haight, a nouveau hippie boutique on the corner of Haight and Masonic that bills itself as \"the center of the tie-dye universe.\"\nIt will be a nostalgic moment for the band's founder, 66-year-old singer-songwriter-guitarist Cleve Hattersley, a New Yorker who was part of the hippie horde that colonized the Haight Ashbury in the '60s.\n\"It has always been a dream of mine to play out there, anywhere,\" he said from his home in Austin. \"And to be able to play a free show, right on Haight Street, in a tie-dye store ...\" he said, his voice blissfully trailing off at the perfect synchronicity of it all.\nAfter the Summer of Love, Hattersley left San Francisco and moved to Texas to deal marijuana, a short-lived occupation that earned him a seven-year prison sentence.\nHe formed the Greezy Wheels during the 2\u03a9 years his case was on appeal. They were an overnight sensation, becoming the house band at Armadillo World Headquarters, a legendary music hall that presented everyone from AC/DC and Asleep at the Wheel to ZZ Top and Frank Zappa.\n\"We became pretty big pretty quickly,\" Hattersley recalled. \"By the time I had to turn myself in, fans were wearing T-shirts that said, 'Free Greezy.'\"\nAfter losing his appeal, he did his time in the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville, a pen notorious for having the most active execution chamber in the U.S. While behind bars, he was chosen to play in the band that performs at the prisoners' annual rodeo.\n\"They made us wear stripes,\" he recalled with a groan. \"It was really sick, man.\"\nHattersley thanks powerful friends in Austin for persuading the governor to commute his sentence, freeing him after serving just 11 months. During his unfortunate incarceration, the band's co-founders, his wife of 40 years, noted fiddle player \"Sweet\" Mary Hattersley, and his singing sister, Lissa Hattersley, kept the Wheels rolling.\nIn 1975, they recorded their debut London Records album at the Record Plant in Sausalito, appeared on the first season of \"Austin City Limits\" and were stars in a flourishing scene that gave rise to the likes of Willie Nelson, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jerry Jeff Walker and Delbert McClinton. Along with the Grateful Dead, they were one of the first of what we now know as jam bands.\n\"Like the Dead, our songs tended to go on for a long time,\" Hattersley explained.\nIn 1978, frustrated by losing band members to other groups, he disbanded the Wheels and went to New York for several years to manage the famed Lone Star Cafe, an urban cowboy outpost in Manhattan where the Wheels had been a popular headliner. With that experience behind him, he was later hired to run the renowned Blue Note jazz club.\nAfter returning to Texas, he managed several name musicians, most notably Kinky Friedman, running Friedman's first gubernatorial campaign.\n\"He was the first independent candidate to ever get on the ballot,\" Hattersley said. \"We got 16 percent of the vote. I'm pretty proud of that.\"\nHe is currently running Friedman's bid to become Texas Agricultural Commissioner on (wait for it) a marijuana legalization platform.\n\"I've always been an advocate of pot reform,\" he said, chuckling.\nIn 2000, he and his wife revived the Wheels after she was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\"We realized we didn't want to do anything else but play the music we always wanted to play,\" he explained.\nIn addition to Hattersley, his wife and sister, the current lineup features backup singer Penny Jo Pullus, a rhythm section of drummer John Bush and bassist Brad Houser, formerly of the New Bohemians, plus keyboardist Matt Hubbard from Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann's band 7 Walkers.\nThey have performed regularly in Texas and have ventured as far as Woodstock, N.Y., to play a couple of the late Levon Helms' Midnight Rambles. Since reforming, they've released five independent albums, the most recent, 2013's \"Kitty Cat Jesus.\"\nReviewing one of their CDs, Margaret Moser wrote in the Austin Chronicle that it \"picks up where Dan Hicks and the Hot Licks left off, but ditches the novelty edge in favor of sly Texas ambiance.\"\nAnd in Texas Monthly, reviewer John Morthland wrote, \"It rocks, it rolls and sometimes it does both at once.\"\nContact Paul Liberatore via email atliberatore@marinij.com ; follow him on Twitter athttp://twitter.com/LibLarge .

Forget what happened last time. That's what Redwood High grad and Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll says.\nThe Seahawks dismantled Saturday's divisional-round playoff opponent the New Orleans Saints 34-7 on Dec. 2. The 188 yards the Saints gained that day were the fewest under head coach Sean Payton, who has been running the team since 2006, save last season, when he was suspended.\nBut, never mind that, Carroll says. This is a new week in a new situation. \n\"It has nothing to do with what happened before,\" Carroll said. \"We learned and we gained information in the game, as they did. We start all over again. Take a look at what's happened since we played them. Compare the build-up, what have they done coming into the game, what did they do, what's happened since then. I think it'd be a mistake to try to call (the result) because of what's happened in the past and all that. We don't care about that.\"\nThe Saints do. Following their 26-24 win Saturday night over the Philadelphia Eagles, New Orleans players immediately spoke of retribution for the December dismantling.\n\"It was embarrassing, humbling. It was all of the above, I guess you could say,\" Jimmy Graham told reporters after the Philadelphia game. \"I certainly won't ever forget that moment. And now we have a great opportunity to prove ourselves against one of the best teams in the NFL. It's gonna be a battle, that's for sure.\"\nLocking down Graham, the Saints Pro-Bowl tight end, was a key part to the first game. Graham had just three catches on nine targets for 42 yards.\nHe wasn't alone in his ineffectiveness. Almost everything the Saints tried did not work. They scored a season-low seven points. Drew Brees threw for a season-low 147 yards, 160 yards fewer than New Orleans' season average. The last time he threw for less than 200 yards was Jan. 2, 2011.\nThe Saints were 25th in rushing yards this season, but have looked to change things up lately. Against the Eagles, the Saints ran 36 times and passed 30. That's a drastic shift in philosophy, especially considering their lead back, Pierre Thomas (chest), did not play. Bowling-ball back Mark Ingram carried a season-high 18 times for 97 yards against Philadelphia's 10th-ranked rushing defense.\n\"It could have been because of that offense, the conditions and all of that,\" Carroll said. \"We'll have to see how that figures into our game.\"\nWhen Shayne Graham kicked a 32-yard field goal as time expired Saturday night, he sent Carroll and staff to work. The Seahawks have faced the Saints twice at CenturyLink Field since Carroll was hired in 2010. Neither are good memories for the Bayou bunch.\nThe first was a 41-36 loss in a wild-card game notable for Marshawn Lynch's \"Beast quake\" run. Brees was 39 for 60 for 404 yards in that game, when the Seahawks' All-Pro secondary was still developing. Richard Sherman hadn't been drafted yet, Earl Thomas was a rookie and Kam Chancellor was splitting time with Lawyer Milloy.\nLess was at stake earlier this season during Monday Night Football with the Seahawks coming off a bye week. The Saints had more first downs (3) from Seahawks penalties than they did rushing (2), despite have Thomas playing at the time. Thomas gained zero yards on four carries.\nThose are points of reference but not reliance for Carroll. He's not going to assume his players automatically realize the earlier result should be jettisoned.\n\"There's no automatics here,\" Carroll said. \"They're going to hear about it. I think it's just common knowledge that it's human nature   you'd like to think that it's going to be the same, but we know better than that. We have to respect this opportunity for what it is. It's a great championship matchup for us. They're going to come loaded up and give us a great football game.\"\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll, left, laughs as he stands near tackle Paul McQuistan (67) during stretching drills before NFL football practice, Friday, Jan. 3, 2014, in Renton, Wash.

What idiot did that? I thought.\nMy stomach turned inside out when I realized the eye of the storm was my trash can. Moments before, it had been filled to the brim with the pink packing material, which had cradled my mother's china on its sentimental journey from California to Florida.\nThe trash men had just been by. It was a windy day. And I had instantly become \nthat neighbor! I can't stand people like me.\nI dashed down the street and began chasing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pink peanuts, asking myself that for the zillionth time: How did I get into this mess? (Yes, I know smartypants. I should have put the peanuts in a drawstring garbage bag, but I didn't. OK?)\nIt all started just before Thanksgiving. I was setting the holiday table, and suddenly got choked up. A wistful wave of nostalgia washed over me as I flashed on all those holiday dinners around my mother's table on her delicate, ivory china with its hand-painted gold pattern.\nNow dad's gone. Mom's in a rest home, and I'm 3,000 miles away trying to make my own meaningful traditions. The family china was sitting in a box in my brother's garage in California waiting for me to claim it.\nLast spring, some of you will recall, I cleared out my parents' home, selling and donating their furnishings. I brought home a few items   some jewelry, glassware, an oil painting   but held off on the silver and china. I wasn't ready emotionally (the memories!) or physically (where to put it!) to deal with the 12 place settings.\nBut as I set the Thanksgiving table, I did some mental math, which sounds like a hand-crank pencil sharpener, and figured that I have likely had more Thanksgivings than I will have.\nForget what anyone tells you. This is the definition of mid-life. And it is a crisis. Suddenly, my desire for mom's china became a stage-five obsession not seen since the days of my pregnancy cravings: I need a barbecue chicken pizza NOW!\n\"Please, send the china,\" I said to my sister-in-law over the phone. She took the boxes straight to Art Ono, owner of the UPS store in Culver City, who promptly panicked.\nIf you want to send a shipper's vital signs into the ozone, just say, \"heirloom china.\" An all-points bulletin goes out to delivery trucks nationwide, and the entire transportation network goes on red alert. No two boxes of china can travel on the same truck for the same reason that the president and vice president can't fly together. Then the packer corners the market on pink peanuts.\nOno, a certified packing expert, and his crew, who happen to be his kids, took the heirloom china job as seriously as a brain tumor. Several days later, I received three boxes the size of Smart cars, and a smaller fourth box, which held the silver.\nThe boxes were so thoroughly packed you could have dropped them from a freeway overpass, and had them knocked around by speeding traffic, and the dishes would have been intact. Only delivery by armored car could have offered more protection.\nMy Christmas table was a beautiful, if sentimental, blend of old and new, mom's gold-rimmed china with my plain ivory, her silver with my crystal. I discarded the packaging.\nAnd that is how, one recent morning, for love, for family, and so I wouldn't make the neighbors mad, I was trolling through neighbors' yards and the streets like a stray dog, chasing that which was fleeting.\nHere is how Ono says you, too, can wrap and pack fragile valuables like a pro:\n*\nPad all parts: When shipping breakables, individually wrap each piece with bubble wrap until you can't feel any edges, said Ono, who used several layers of small-bubble wrap on each dish. Next put a layer of peanuts on the bottom of the box. Layer in wrapped dishes so they're not touching, add another layer of peanuts, then more dishes. Once filled, overstuff the box with more peanuts so nothing moves.\n*\nBox the box: Ono then put that box in another box, two inches bigger all around, and filled the gap with more peanuts.\n*\nAssume rough handling: When packages ship by ground, they typically go from truck to truck, and \"can be thrown around quite a bit,\" said Ono, \"even when they say fragile.\" Picture boxes being dropped from a height of three feet, and pack accordingly.\n*\nNix the newspaper: The most common mistakes Ono sees self-packers make are wrapping breakables in paper, and leaving too much room in the box. \"When you grab a box you shouldn't feel contents moving,\" he said. \"But customers bring their china in that way and think it's ready to ship.\" UPS is good about honoring insurance, but often want to inspect the packing to see why an item broke. \"If it's because the sender didn't pack properly, it's not UPS's fault.\"\n*\nInsure it: With UPS, each box is automatically insured for $100. For $1.50 more per box you can buy an additional $100 of protection.\n*\nSticker shock: This kind of packing doesn't come cheap. Ono said he can usually pack eight place settings of dishes in two boxes, and charges $100 per box. Shipping and insurance get added to that. To pack, ship and insure our four boxes cost $500. When I asked Ono if perhaps he over packed, he asked me, \"Was anything broken?\" No, I told him. \"Then the job was perfect,\" he said. Can't argue with that.\nSyndicated columnist Marni Jameson is the author of \"House of Havoc\" and \"The House Always Wins\" (Da Capo Press).

But she has her students learning a whole new way.\nThis past week her class, made up of fourth- and fifth-graders, did reports on the book, \"The Sign of the Beaver,\" from which they each explained how a symbol in the story represented the relationship between the two main characters.\nThey prepared their reports on Keynote   Apple's software equivalent to Microsoft PowerPoint   using iPads. Through a wireless communication between the students' iPads and O'Donnell's Apple TV, each presentation was beamed, one after another, onto the screen at the front of the room. \n\"Instead of doing paper-pencil tasks, they're allowed to have an iPad in front of them,\" O'Donnell said. \"It's making sure the students are more engaged in the projects they're creating.\"\nWhile not every classroom has iPads at its disposal, schools throughout Marin County and the country are rapidly becoming more digitized, turning to computers and online programs to teach lesson plans. That's increasing the demand for stronger Internet connections, or greater bandwidth, to support that increased use.\nBandwidth is basically a measurement of how much information an Internet connection can access at any given time.\nDemand \"has grown dramatically in the last couple years,\" said Doug Lancaster, director of information technology for the County Office of Education. \"All of our districts are clamoring for additional bandwidth, just because of the demand that is required to effectively use online tools.\"\nMeeting that demand is an expensive endeavor, which adds yet another cost to tightly strapped education budgets.\nMost schools in the country benefit from federal-mandated subsidies offered through the E-rate program, which in the current fiscal year has up to $2.4 billion to aid schools with costs associated with Internet service.\nInternet connectivity is generally less of a problem in more urban areas, where the infrastructure for electronic communication is more robust. But, much like cellphone coverage, Internet connections are often less reliable in more rural areas.\nThat is why Rep. Jared Huffman, D-San Rafael, along with about two dozen other members of Congress, wrote a letter last month to the FCC, which oversees the E-rate program. Legislators are pushing to modernize and expand broadband Internet connections, particularly in more rural areas.\nFor Huffman, much of the thrust is to improve Internet access in the northern reaches of his congressional district, which extends all the way to the Oregon border.\nIn places such as Mendocino and Trinity counties, \"You've got broadband deserts, basically,\" Huffman said.\nBut the appeal to the FCC is in support of all schools, no matter how well-wired some classrooms are.\n\"We're seeing a lot of new innovations in education, and some of it involves remote learning,\" Huffman said. \"That obviously requires cutting-edge, broadband technology.\"\nOfficials in the Lagunitas School District, which serves the San Geronimo Valley, say their two schools need more bandwidth. The district of 300 students is keeping pace with the integration of technology in classrooms, making computers part of the regular classroom experience.\nBut any learning exercises that rely on the school's Internet access are at the mercy of a spotty connection.\n\"It's hard when you have a classroom of students all ready to start a project, and a slow Internet connection is holding them up,\" said Laura Shain, principal of both Lagunitas district schools. \"As we look forward, we are purchasing more computers and integrating technology even further, so we will probably see more interruptions\" due to a slow Internet connection.\nThat could become particularly problematic next school year, when Common Core curriculum testing is fully implemented, Shain said. The state's new standardized testing will be done on computers, with the use of the Internet. If Lagunitas doesn't have adequate Internet service by then, that could cause problems with the testing process, Shain said.\nWhether it's increasing bandwidth or helping school districts save money, the E-rate program benefits schools throughout the county.\nThe amount of money a district receives is based, in part, on the number of its students who qualify for free school lunches   an easy way to measure a district's number of low-income students. So, wealthier districts receive less financial help for their Internet systems   somewhere on the order of 20 percent of related expenditures.\nThe San Rafael City Schools District, which has more low-income students, will have 70 percent of its telecommunications costs this school year covered by E-rate money, saving the district more than $220,000. Novato Unified School will have $80,000 of its $140,000 costs covered by E-rate.\n\"Some significant dollars are being realized from E-rate,\" Lancaster said.\nBut as classrooms become increasingly more geared toward learning with computers and the Internet, the demand for dollars is likely to go up as well.\n\"Certainly we're trying to send the message that this is an important thing to consider,\" Lancaster said, \"that we would not only like to maintain what we have, but also increase funds, because demand continues to increase.\"\nContact Laith Agha via email atlagha@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Hannah Morgan and Owen J.

In actual numbers, it estimates 14,000 illegal immigrants live in Marin.\nI suspect that figure is now quite a bit higher since the Obama administration has refused to secure our borders and the politicians in Sacramento also are not doing anything to stop the flow of illegal immigrants into California.\nInstead, they pass laws allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.\nIs something wrong with this picture?\nAssume that each illegal immigrant has a household of six. That's 2,333 rental units occupied by illegal immigrants. Simple supply and demand is at work here   less supply, the higher the rents.\nBefore anyone jumps to conclusions, I am not a racist, I'm simply pointing out the facts.\nJ.M.

These wreaths make me smile as I come home at the end of the day.\nThe wreaths aren't part of any formal town or chamber holiday decoration program but are put up every year by a Cascades area resident   an anonymous holiday gift to the community.\nI want to publicly say thank you to that individual.

Leave that to the small-time, gutter press, such as the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal.\nLeave it to researchers from Harvard, MIT, Columbia,and the Kaiser Family Foundation, obviously mouthpieces for the right wing.\nDon't you realize who you really serve?

I really must take issue with her slur that the IJ is \"way too right-wing stupid.\" If she really reads and digests what is on the pages of the paper she will find that the IJ is neither \"stupid\" nor \"right wing.\"\nIt is a liberal news organization that would do well to work on being a little more fair and balanced.

The bridge district operates the ferry system. \nDwight Steeves of San Rafael, who sits on the district's Ferry Passenger Advisory Committee, said he is concerned about the plan. He questions the relatively small amount of money that would be generated in the face of a multi-million-dollar deficit and views the fee as an impediment to taking public transit.\n\"The whole idea of charging for parking makes people less inclined to take the ferry,\" he said. \"You want to make public transit as inexpensive as possible, not put up obstacles.\"\nBut officials say the new system will be easy to use, relying on a mobile payment system instead of a crossing arm and a machine distributing tickets.\n\"The system will be license plate-based,\" said Mary Currie, spokeswoman for the bridge district. \"There will be someone at the terminal to go around and make sure people paid by checking plates.\"\nRiders who don't pay can get dinged with a $45 fine.\nThe district will use the \"Parkmobile\" mobile payment system. Customers register for free and pay via the Internet, a toll-free telephone service or by downloading a mobile app for the iPhone, Android, Windows or Blackberry smartphones.\nParkmobile transactions are linked to the license plate number of the vehicle parking in the lot. There would be no need to display tickets on a dashboard or require a parking stall number assignment. The app would be used for up to two years in a pilot program. There also will be options for people who prefer to pay by cash.\nThe first-ever parking charge at the lot is expected to generate $400,000 a year for the cash-strapped district, which has a $142 million, five-year deficit. It is also looking at raising bridge tolls.\nThe fee will be in effect from 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. weekdays. The fee would not be collected on weekends or on seven holidays. The district will offer a $20 monthly parking pass. That would drop the fee to $1 a day.\nBridge officials are looking to implement the fee as a way to generate revenue and encourage people to find other ways to the ferry terminal beyond parking at the lot. There are 1,800 spaces provided to ferry riders and all those are often filled by 8:30 a.m. weekdays. The district now runs a pilot shuttle   The Wave   out of the Ross Valley to the terminal.\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Clouds reflect in the windshields of parked cars at the Larkspur Ferry Terminal on Monday, Dec. 17, 2012, in Larkspur, Calif.

This is all from me and a couple of my clients,\" said the Ross resident, who started the fund in January 2013.\nThe first beneficiary of the fund was Michelle Knight, one of three Cleveland, Ohio women held captive for more than a decade. Knight, who vanished in 2002 at the age of 20, was rescued in May 2013 from the Cleveland house where she was imprisoned, raped and abused.\n\"The first chunk of our money went to Michelle to pay her rent,\" said McLaughlin, who sent Knight a check for $6,000 in July. Knight, estranged from her mother, had nowhere to go after she was rescued.\n\"I have a beautiful hand-printed note from Michelle,\" McLaughlin said. \"She said she was honored and 'eternally grateful' for the grant. She said the money 'made it possible for me to stay at a home where I feel safe, secure and cared for.'\n\"I put that note on my bulletin board in the kitchen. I look at it every morning,\" McLaughlin said.\n\"I had a baby who passed away, but at least I had a chance to say goodbye to her. These parents (of missing children) don't ever have a chance to say goodbye,\" the agent added.\nMcLaughlin, a lifelong Ross resident, has three surviving children, Ross, 20, who is in business school in Colorado; Whitney, 15, a student at Marin Catholic High School; and Grace, 14, a student at Ross Elementary School.\n\"I was thinking about starting a charity for a long time (before the fund),\" McLaughlin said. \"I've been successful in my career and I wanted to do something to give back.\"\nSeeing a television program on missing children led her to call Klaas, who she knew through his wife Violet, the manager of Pacific Union's Kentfield office.\n\"I said, 'If these children are abducted, who helps the parents financially? I imagine they are immobilized,' and he said, 'There is nothing to help them.'\"\n\"I thought it was a great idea,\" said Klaas, who in the aftermath of the 1993 kidnap and murder of his 12-year-old daughter Polly gave up a high-powered career to pursue an aggressive child safety agenda.\nKlaas worked with McLaughlin to establish the fund. Donations to Klaas Family Housing are tax-deductible because it is a program of the Sausalito-based KlaasKids Foundation, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. The foundation was established in 1994 to create a legacy in the name of Polly Klaas. Its mission is to stop crimes against children.\nReferring to the housing fund, \"We still have plenty of money in the fund and we are actively looking for another recipient, someone we can help. We were very, very happy to help her (Knight),\" Klaas said.\n\"When I saw the note she wrote, it had one of the most unbelievable lines I've ever heard, considering the context.

(Carolina's game-winning FG drive in the fourth quarter started in 49ers' territory after a good Ted Ginn Jr. punt return.)\nAnd I think the 49ers offense is far better than it was in that game   it has Michael Crabtree in the line-up this time, and it has Colin Kaepernick playing at a higher level (and probably healthier) than he was back then.\nblogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami/", "author": "Bay Area News Group", "title": "Combing the blogs: 49ers have a slight edge heading into Sunday's game"}, {"relevance": [115.25], "text": "Saturday's local events\nCOLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nCOM at Merritt           7:30 p.m.           Oakland\nCOLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nCOM at Merritt           5:30 p.m.           Oakland\nHIGH SCHOOL BOYS BASKETBALL           Time           Place \nBay Area: Marin Academy at Bay           11 a.m.           San Francisco\nBranson at Novato           7:30 p.m.           Novato\nJustin-Siena at Marin Catholic           7:30 p.m.           Kentfield\nRedwood at San Marin           7:30 p.m.           San Marin\nTerra Linda at San Rafael           7:30 p.m.           San Rafael\nDrake at Tam           7:30 p.m.           Mill Valley\nHIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nBay Area: San Domenico vs. Urban           3:30 p.m.           International Bay Area: Marin Academy vs. Bay           3:30 p.m.           San Francisco\nRedwood at San Marin           6 p.m.           San Marin\nBranson at Novato           6 p.m.           Novato\nJustin-Siena at Marin Catholic           6 p.m.           Kentfield\nDrake at Tam           6 p.m.           Mill Valley\nTerra Linda at San Rafael           6 p.m.           San Rafael\nHIGH SCHOOL WRESTLING           Time           Place\nRedwood at Clayton Valley Invitational           TBA           Concord San Rafael girls at Napa Valley Classic           9 a.m.           Vintage High\nsunday's local events\nNo events scheduled\nON THE AIR saturDAY\nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL           Time           TV           Radio\nSt. Louis at Dayton           8 a.m.           ESPN2\nIowa State at Oklahoma           9 a.m.           ESPNU\nNorth Carolina at Syracuse           9 a.m.           ESPN           1050 AM\nSt. Bonaventure at UMass           9:30 a.m.           NBCS\nFlorida at Arkansas           10 a.m.           ESPN2\nTexas Christian at Baylor           10:30 a.m.           Ch. 20\nKansas State at Kansas           11 a.m.           ESPN\nMissouri at Auburn           11 a.m.           ESPNU\nTulane at North Texas           11 a.m.           CSN\nRhode Island at G.

His friends began to sing \"Happy Birthday\" as he entered the Marin Bocce Federation on B Street and was stopped every few feet to receive a hug. \nSaccone said his son-in-law Bob Albertazi pulled a fast one on him, casually asking him whether he wanted to go play bocce in the afternoon. He had no idea a lavish surprise party had been in the works for weeks.\n\"I didn't have the least bit of a clue and I almost didn't come,\" Saccone said. \"If there ever was a camouflage, this is it.\"\nThe centenarian, whose official birthday is Monday, was so thrilled that he couldn't even sit down or touch the huge spread of food prepared by his friends until he came down from what he described as \"cloud nine.\"\nSaccone is well known in the community for founding United Markets with his brother in 1955, which he turned over to two of his store managers in the 1990s. He founded the grocery after serving with Gen. George Patton's Third Army during World War II. He's a veteran of many Marin civic organizations, including the Marin Italian Athletic Club and the Marin Bocce Federation.\nRaffaele Salvemini, of San Rafael, has Italian roots like Saccone and helped him open markets in Mill Valley, Rohnert Park and San Anselmo. The two men have known each other for more than 40 years and Salvemini said he had a wonderful boss, who he now also plays bocce with.\n\"Joe was always hands-on. He'd always come in and ask how it was going,\" Salvemini said. \"I have a lot of respect for him.\"\nPlaying bocce is a way of life for Saccone, who plays at least three times a week and has the type of hand-eye coordination athletes dream of. He helped open the bocce club in 1994, but the sport truly became an all-encompassing activity after his wife of 72 years, Elda Rita Saccone, died in 2012.\n\"I'm just sad my wife isn't here,\" Saccone said, wishing she'd been part of his party.\nBoth Saccone and his late wife are treasured members of the club and known for winning all the gold medals in tournaments. Many of his friends said he's simply too good at the sport, and they wouldn't dare play him for money.\nTom Miller, of Novato, said Saccone plays to win, but he does so in such a friendly and courteous manner.\n\"He's a role model for anyone around him,\" Miller said. \"He's an exceptional human being.\"\nDieter Vielhauer, of San Rafael, agreed.\n\"He's made a real impression on everybody. He's a real sincere and friendly gentleman,\" Vielhauer said.\nFor Nancy Martino, of Novato, Saccone is the man who taught her how to play bocce about eight years ago. She said his guidance has been greatly appreciated.\n\"He's an absolute good sport and it's hard to beat him,\" Marino said.\nAs Saccone made his way around the party, receiving kiss after kiss from all the women in attendance who claimed he is a huge flirt, his daughter Noella Albertazi reflected on how amazing it is that her father is so loved.\n\"Is there anybody he doesn't know?\" Albertazi said. \"It's humbling and it's fun. I feel good when I'm around him and he has the funniest stories.\"\nAlbertazi and her husband moved from Lake Tahoe to San Rafael after her mother died, helping her father take care of his house and himself. She said last week her father had a wonderful pre-birthday celebration when all of his grandchildren were in town. And what did the family do? Play bocce, of course.\n\"Grandpa ran the bocce clinic and the final game came down to a team with his two little granddaughters on it. They were screaming and jumping up and down. He had a ball,\" Albertazi said.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

Gatti is participating as a member of the steering committee and as an artist. Proceeds will benefit the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. \n\"San Francisco is a small town but is also a place of innovation and industrial design,\" Gatti proudly points out. He cites the city's gastronomical achievements (\"No one can touch us for food!\") and includes in his geographical spread the Bay Area regions between the Wine Country and Silicon Valley.\n\"We've always been the melting pot of creativity,\" he says. \"FOG Design + Art just wants to bring San Francisco to the forefront of the design world. It's good for the people living here, too. It brings visitors to into hotels, restaurants and shops.\"\nIt will be the \"perfect place to become inspired,\" says Denise Lamott, spokeswoman and Muir Beach resident. \"There will be nearly 40 of the nation's top artists, designers and dealers from San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Dallas and Chicago showcasing vintage and contemporary modern design, art, fashion, fine home furnishings, lighting and books.\"\nThere will be panel discussions and talks with modernists such as Craig Dykers, a principal of Snohetta, the architectural firm in charge of the SFMOMA's expansion, and Ron Arad, a London-based architect and designer.\n\"Ron Arad is just one of the innovators that anyone who has an interest in design should know about,\" says Gatti.\nThere also will be daily performances of Jurg Lehni's Hektor, a robotic artist that produces posters that resemble paint-splattered graffiti that will be for sale. For those who get hungry, there will be organic salads and soups, sandwiches, coffee, juices, wines and baked goods by Jane at the FOG Caf\u00c8.\nThen, there is Gatti's own installation called 21POP, a natural outgrowth of his upbringing in New Mexico where his mother loved to throw parties and his father handmade everything from her rolling pin to their dustpan and birdbath.\n\"We live in a time when the 10- to 14-year-olds think everything is made in China and bought on Amazon,\" he says. \"I want people to have an outlet to see many great craftsmen.\"\nSo, his exhibit is a kitchen made of plywood that will serve as a backdrop for the offerings of talented creators who have caught his eye   a new sustainable dishwashing soap (\"a cool boutique product,\" he promises) from San Francisco's Heliotrope; copper pots and ladles from a North Carolina artist; and from another artisan, \"the most beautiful mortar and pestles you've ever seen.\"\nThe centerpiece, however, will be the launch of a packaged pasta   fresh and dried   line by former Mill Valley residents Michael and Lindsay Tusk of the San Francisco restaurants Quince and Cotogna.\n\"Because it's them, the pasta will be perfect every time,\" he insists.\n\"There will be so many cool things to see, just like a well-curated store or a well-appointed house,\" Gatti concludes. \"It will be just a whole lot of beauty.\"\nPJ Bremier may be contacted atpj@pjbremier.com .\nif you go\nWhat: San Francisco FOG Design +Art\nWhen: Gala preview, 6 to 9 p.m. Jan. 16; FOG Design + Art, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Jan. 17 and 18, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Jan. 19\nWhere: Festival Pavilion, Fort Mason, 2 Marina Blvd., San Francisco\nAdmission: $15 online atfogfair.com or $20 at the door; gala preview $150 and up\nInformation: 551-5190;fogfair.com\nMore: The FOG Fair Design + Art exhibitor catalog is online atartsy.net\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Courtesy of Stanlee R.

At least that's been the experience of the seven Marin women who make up Rita & the Cosmos.\n\"My dad was a real ham. He could imitate Al Johnson like nobody's business,\" says Rita Gershengorn, who founded the a capella singing group in 2005. \"My sister and my parents and I would sing all the time.\" \nAs a third-grade teacher and chorus director at Brandeis Hillel Day School in San Rafael for more than 20 years, Gershengorn was used to leading 5- to 9-year-olds in song, although she also wrote and performed music and parodies for adults all her life.\nWhen the 70-year-old San Rafael mother of two and grandmother of three retired, she was eager to find a group of musically minded women with whom she could sing. She didn't have to search too long or hard; the first three band members who joined her are the mothers of her former students.\nThe Cosmos, whose members range from their 50s to 70s, are \"adorable and sassy women,\" she says. \"We really have a good time together and it's obvious to the audience that we're enjoying ourselves and as a result they enjoy themselves as well.\"\nIn matching outfits from shimmering metallic to animal prints and with a collection of classics like \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" \"Cabaret,\" \"Yes Sir, That's My Baby\" and \"I Got the Sun in the Mornin',\" the group mostly performs at assisted living and nursing homes and is a regular at Atria Tamalpais Creek in Novato. They will perform Jan. 9 at the Belvedere-Tiburon Public Library for the first time.\n\"We know the names of the people and they know us,\" says Gershengorn, who arranges the 80 to 90 songs in their repertoire. \"We get the joy of performing, but they just love being taken back in time with the songs they remember.\"\n\"You can reach people through music. Some people can't be reached any other way,\" says Lauren Long of Novato, at 53 the youngest member of the Cosmos. \"It has a special connection for so many people.

Bobbi Bishop, 59, says she's become a better singer.\n\"In the last couple of years, Rita's had me singing harmony, which is new for me and so I'm keeping my little brain alive,\" jokes Bishop, who also grew up singing with her family.\nLong is happy to be learning more about harmony, too. But the geriatric physical therapist also loves that they group performs for elders. And, she says, the women are a heck of a lot of fun.\n\"They're like sisters. They're really showing me what the next phase can be like. They're very active,\" she says. \"They're fascinating women and busy living their lives in that stage I'm just about to launch into.\"\n\"They're a really caring group of ladies. We all have the same goal in mind, to bring some joy to people and to be perfect. We all work really hard at blending and getting the harmonies right,\" notes Bishop, a retired escrow officer.\nStill, they encourage seniors to sing along, \"even though sometimes it interferes with the perfection of our performance,\" Gershengorn says. \"It just means so much to them to capture all these words they probably didn't remember they had in their memory banks.\"\n\"We always have a packed house when Rita & the Cosmos play. It's one of our featured events,\" says Marc Johnson, Atria Tamalpais Creek's Engage Life director. \"Their performances are always new and fresh.\"\nPerforming for seniors has its hardships, however. Often they return to a place and someone has died. They began singing \"Sentimental Journey\" at the end of their performances in honor of a beloved World War II veteran who died a few years ago.\n\"When we started singing 'Sentimental Journal,' he was almost in tears. It was so painful to go there and he was gone,\" Gershengorn says.\nBut, she acknowledges, \"We're all on the same path.

That's one of the reasons why the city stepped up its crackdown on homeless camps. It's also a reason why Phillips says it is time for Marin to get serious about opening another emergency shelter.\nIn 2009, the Marin County grand jury studied the local homeless issue. It called for creation of a new shelter, but officials couldn't agree on a site or who should pay for it.\nInto this sad political limbo stepped local churches and synagogues that banded together to start an emergency winter shelter program that rotated among local parishes. The program, now in its sixth year, has been an admirable example of human compassion and community service.\nBut those parishes are talking about winding down their program in favor of officials finally getting serious about a new winter shelter.\nIn November, Mayor Phillips and Larry Meredith, the director of the county Department of Health and Human Services, shook hands and promised they would work toward opening a new shelter.\nCorte Madera's fire sent two clear messages.\nFirst, the grand jury called Marin's homeless population \"the 'invisible' problem that won't disappear.\" The report said that Marin's homeless are \"invisible,\" either by choice or because others would prefer to ignore the problem.\nThe Corte Madera fire is an example that the homeless aren't all that \"invisible.\" The fire could be seen for miles and firefighting squads from Corte Madera, Larkspur, San Rafael and Kentfield were needed to put out the blaze.\nIn fact, the fire department said a Sept. 27 fire nearby also was possibly started in a homeless camp.\nThe second message is that this is not just a San Rafael problem.\nSan Rafael and Novato may be the centers for shelters and services for local homeless, but it is a countywide issue that deserves countywide attention.\nWe hope that the pledge by San Rafael and the county to work toward opening a permanent winter shelter program really does move forward as a countywide initiative, not \"the county's responsibility\" or \"San Rafael's problem.\"\nLast week's fire should serve as another reminder that there is a need for a new shelter and meeting that need should not be mired in a debate over location.\nIn 2009, in response to the grand jury report, the Corte Madera Town Council responded that it was \"willing to consider participating in a joint effort.\" The town's \"commitment,\" the council wrote, \"will depend on the scope of the effort, the cost and the likelihood of effectiveness.\"\nThose are good places to start.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: A fire at a homeless encampment in Corte Madera near the Village shopping center burns Thursday, Jan. 2, 2014.

The North Marin Water District, which provides water to Novato and West Marin to 60,000 people, gets 80 percent of its water from Sonoma and the rest from Stafford Lake.\nComing out of a record dry year in 2013, officials are hoping to extend the Lake Sonoma supply as long as possible before it reaches a critical level.\nThe campaign will feature ads online in local broadcast and print outlets urging residents to conserve water, cutting down landscape irrigation, car washing, and other outdoor activities and publicizing existing programs to replace indoor appliances and fixtures with more efficient models.\nThis builds on an earlier campaign, over the summer, urging residents to take the \"20 gallon challenge,\" reducing their usage by that much every day. This new call, however, is much more urgent given the dire lack of precipitation in the rainy season so far.\nMarin just experienced its driest year on record. In 2013, 10.68 inches of rain were recorded at Lake Lagunitas, where the Marin Municipal Water District   which has data dating to 1879   keeps its official weather gauge.\nThe previous record low was set in 1929 when 19.06 inches of rain fell. The annual average is 52 inches per year.\nForecasters say there is a glimmer of hope for later this year, with some early signs that warming water in the Pacific may generate the condition known as \"El Ni\u00d2o\" that normally means wetter weather on the West Coast.\nIn the short term, however, the North Bay has little prospect of rain. The National Weather Service said this week that a weak weather system will move into the Pacific Northwest over the next few days, bringing a dusting of snow to the Sierra and rain to the upper Sacramento Valley as early as Saturday, but that is unlikely to generate much precipitation in Marin and Sonoma.\nThe wintertime conservation campaign is intended to save water now and get customers accustomed to drought conditions going into the summer, when demand peaks and Lake Sonoma will be under the most strain should the winter remain dry, said Grant Davis, general manager of the Sonoma County Water Agency.\nThe worst-case scenario, he said, would be to see water levels drop so low that the cities such as Novato can't get the water they need and flows in the river falls so low as to damage habitat for wildlife. \"And that is a real possibility ... we have to plan for that,\" he said.\nInformation on the drought situation and tips for conserving water are available atwateroff.org .\nDistributed by MCT Information Services.

The pastime can build character and it is not always supposed to be easy. Fishing may involve more watching of birds, marine mammals, traffic on a bridge and waves on the water than it might of interacting with fish.\nFishermen expect to be skunked at times, which makes the successful days all the more notable and gives meaning to \"big fish\" stories. All this tends to be especially true of sturgeon fishing, which can require a dozen or more slow and tedious hours of watching the rod tip before it dips toward the water   a bite! \nBut in the early days of 2014, sturgeon fishing has been unusually productive. San Rafael fisherman Ken Brown, along with his 15-year-old son   also named Ken   spent three days fishing together during the younger Brown's holiday vacation. The teenager caught a fish per trip, including two sturgeon as big as an angler can reasonably expect to catch in San Pablo Bay. One was an ideal   and legal   size to bring home and share at the table with his mother in Fair Oaks. One was the size of a man. One was even bigger.\n\"I had to make him understand that this is unusual,\" Ken Brown Sr. said. \"These were fish of a lifetime. He spent 10 days with me (visiting from his home in Sacramento County) and caught a seven- and an eight-foot sturgeon. How often does that happen?\"\nOn Dec. 30, the Browns caught and released the seven-footer, a spirited sturgeon that jumped several times before it was unhooked and released, and it was on Jan. 3 that they landed the 44-inch keeper.\nBut the big fish came in between, on Jan. 2. Most sturgeon cautiously, slowly, work on a bait. This registers at the rod tip as a famously subtle disturbance   a bob-bob-bob that novice anglers may never even notice as the sturgeon strips the hook and moves on. But this big sturgeon took the mud shrimp in what sturgeon fishermen call a \"suicide run.\" That is, it inhaled the bait and ran. Bat rays almost always take a bait this way. Also characteristic of a ray, the hooked fish immediately took about 600 feet of line, Brown Sr. said.\n\"I thought it was just a stingray,\" he said. \"It never jumped or anything, but my son said, 'Nah, it's a sturgeon   I can tell.'\"\nAfter almost 30 minutes of ambiguous resistance, the stubborn fish arrived at the side of the boat. It was clearly oversized, and the Browns unhooked it without removing it from the water. They marked the side of the boat at the tail and the head ends of the fish, which was unusually skinny, and later recorded an exact length: 102 inches, 81/2 feet long.\nWhere the Browns had success with size, other anglers have simply brought in large numbers of sturgeon. Sean Daugherty, a San Rafael fisherman, took several friends out of Loch Lomond Marina on New Year's Day. For two hours, the fishing was slow, as the tide wasn't yet moving. When the water began to surge out   it was one of the highest tides of the year   the bite began. One fish came in, then another and another. A keeper striped bass was taken, and a shaker was released. Sturgeon, one after another, sucked in the anglers' baits. At least one rod was bent toward the water for much of the afternoon, and for a few moments, Daugherty and one of his friends   Joe Sarmiento, writer of the SoCal Salty fishing blog   fought big sturgeon simultaneously. Big armored fish thrashed like crocodiles on the surface. It was, in popular terminology of star-struck anglers recovering from an action-packed day, epic.\nToward sundown, the first day of the 2014 sturgeon season was done. The tally: eight sturgeon and two striped bass. All fish except one striper were let go. The hot action persisted all week, and over a handful of trips Daugherty says he caught and released almost 30 sturgeon.\nBig tides in the coming week bode well for more fast action.\nAlastair Bland is a Bay Area fisherman.

Jerry Brown's proposed $106.8 billion general-fund budget that seeks to pay off a big chunk of the state's long-term debt while making modest investments in public schools, health care and the troubled bullet train.\n\"We're glad not to be dealing with cuts like what we've experienced in previous years,\" said Marin County Administrator Matthew Hymel. \nSaid Assemblyman Marc Levine: \"I applaud Gov. Brown's fiscal restraint while continuing our reinvestment in education.\"\nWhile the state's finances have improved significantly since the days of embarrassing, multibillion-dollar deficits, Brown said Thursday he believes the newfound fiscal stability could be short-lived and that restrained spending of scarce state resources is crucial.\nThe governor calls for spending $11 billion   or more than 10 percent of the total budget   to pay down $24.9 billion in remaining debts the state racked up during the previous decade. More than half of that money would be used to repay public schools, whose state aid payments were slashed by as much as 20 percent in recent years to balance the budget.\nHe also wants to put $1.6 billion in a \"rainy day fund\" that will help the state get through future recessions.\nBrown noted that when you include unfunded term pension obligations in the massive \"wall of debt,\" the total comes to about $355 billion.\n\"When you're at this level of long-term liability, it isn't time to just embark on a raft of new initiatives,\" Brown said at a Capitol news conference.\nHymel said county officials \"support the state's efforts to pay down their liabilities, as well as proposals to strengthen the state's rainy day fund to avoid boom and bust cycles in state funding.\"\nMary Jane Burke, Marin County superintendent of schools, said Brown's budget is \"very good for education across the state. The direction of reinvesting in public education is exactly what I think our children need.\"\nBurke added, however, \"I would want our community to be reminded though that it will be another seven years before public schools in our state are funded at the level they were funded during the 2007-08 year.\"\nShe said that educators were informed Wednesday during a meeting of the county's school superintendents that Marin schools will be losing close to $1 million in special education funding over the next two years due to federal sequestration cuts.\nIn a blog posting, Tamalpais Union High School District Superintendent Laurie Kimbrel wrote that her district will receive no increase in state funding, due to a new state formula for allocating education funds that was instituted last year.\nKimbrel wrote, \"The state revenue cuts we experienced during the recession will not be restored and our district will continue to rely almost exclusively on local funding.\"\nThe new formula introduced last year directs more money to schools with high numbers of lower-income students, English-learners and foster children.\nBrown's budget fails to address long-term liabilities in the state's teacher retirement fund, which will require billions of dollars extra a year to make solvent. Instead, Brown said he wants to create a plan for long-term solvency this year. The teachers' pension fund is estimated to be $80 billion in the red.\nWednesday's early-evening leaks of the budget to the media forced the Brown administration to move up a news conference scheduled for Friday morning. Brown was scheduled to promote his budget plan later Thursday in San Diego and Los Angeles to get maximum media exposure in an election year.\nThe governor also wants to commit $670 million in new money to the expansion of Medi-Cal benefits for mental health, substance abuse, adult dental and specialized nutrition coverage.\nLarry Meredith, director of the Marin County Department of Health and Human Services, welcomed the increased Medi-Cal funding.\n\"We're slowly clawing our way back to where we were before the Great Recession,\" Meredith said. \"It is a time of modest enthusiasm, but we're not breaking out the party favors yet because we want to know the details.\"\nThe state's $68 billion high-speed rail project, which has been snarled by recent court rulings that block the state's use of bond proceeds to fund the project, will also get a boost next fiscal year that could prove to be a lifeline, according to the governor's spending blueprint.\nBrown wants the bullet train to get $250 million generated by the state's landmark cap-and-trade law   and the controversial funding would continue for years. Another $600 million in fees this fiscal year would fund projects that reduce transportation emissions, increase energy efficiency and restore some state forests.\nThe independent Legislative Analyst's Office is projecting a $3.2 billion surplus for the next fiscal year and continued budget surpluses for the next several years.\nA daunting $27 billion deficit greeted Brown when he returned to the governor's office in January 2011   nearly three decades after he left the office. So he laid out an austere path riddled with billions of dollars in education and social service cuts that devastated his own Democratic constituencies.\nThe governor's cautionary approach is caused in part by the source of the state's revenue. His budget assumes about $4 billion in capital gains tax revenue, driven by the soaring stock market. But it also acknowledges that such income is highly volatile and will probably be short-lived.\nBrown's tax increases under Proposition 30   the tax measure voters approved in November 2012   will begin expiring later this decade: The state sales tax hike will last four years and the higher income taxes on those making more than $250,000 a year will last seven years.\nDespite Brown's call for budgetary prudence, the 8.5 percent increase in general fund spending over the current fiscal year includes additional money for nearly every area of state government. That includes $45.2 billion for K-12 schools, an increase of nearly $4 billion from the current fiscal year.\nThe University of California, California State University and community college systems will receive a total of $1.1 billion. About half the money would go to community colleges, which are expected to grow rapidly in the next few years.\nThe budget also proposes $815 million for critical deferred maintenance in state parks, highways, schools, courts and other state facilities, and $619 million to expand water storage capacity, improve drinking water supplies and increase flood protection.\nThe Associated Press and Independent Journal reporter Richard Halstead contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Gov.

Carly Holboke and Sarah Nelson each added 13 points while Lauren Hyatt and Noelle Roldan each chipped in 10 points apiece. Danielle Yamauchi dished out eight assists.\nDominican (2-12, 1-6 PacWest) had by far its best shooting night of the season, going 28-of-57 (49.1 percent) from the field. The Penguins also won the rebounding battle 41-33, with Hyatt leading all players with 11. That gave the senior center her second double-double of the season. Nelson and Quewon-Owens each pulled down eight boards apiece.\nThe first half was closely contested until Dominican took the lead, 19-17, with 6:43 to go. From there, the Penguins steadily built the lead to 42-32 at halftime. Dominican extended the lead to as large as 17 before the final buzzer sounded.\nDanna Lynn Hooper led the Seasiders (0-10, 0-4) with 18 points.\nDominican men fall\nLAIE, Hawaii   Devin Golston scored 18 points, but it wasn't enough as the Dominican University men's basketball team lost to host BYU-Hawaii 87-82.\nFellow seniors Myles Carrillo added 17 and Dominique Taplin added 16 points for the Penguins (11-5, 5-3 PacWest). Jonny Bates, who made the start, had six points but the Dominican bench combined for just eight points compared to the Seasiders (6-5, 4-1), whose reserves scored 46 points.\nRegulation consisted of two even 39-point halves by each squad. Hawaii's biggest lead was by four and the Penguins led by as much as 10 at one point, including by six with five and half minutes left in regulation. The Seasiders took a one-point lead inside of two minutes and free throws by both teams resulted in the game's 16th tie of the game to end regulation.\nAfter shooting 60 percent in the second half, Dominican went just 2 of 7 (.286) from the field while BYU-Hawaii made half of its attempts (3 of 6).\nCarrillo shot 7 of 14 from the field, dished out eight assists, and grabbed five rebounds before fouling out late in overtime. Haysbert led the Penguins with six rebounds and Golston and Taplin each reeled in five rebounds.\nFour Seasiders also reached double digits, led by 15 from Pablo Coro off of the bench. Scott Friel recorded a double-double with 11 points and a game-high 11 rebounds.

And now that they are older and go out on their own, we often hear, \"There's nothing to do in Novato   will you drive us to ...?\" \nWe drive to the bowling alleys in Petaluma and San Rafael, Cal-Skate in Rohnert Park, the ice rink in Santa Rosa, that inflatable bounce-house place in Cotati, the arcade in San Rafael and that laser-tag place in Rohnert Park.\nYears ago, we were driving them to Chuck E. Cheese in Rohnert Park.\nAnd all of those towns get our tax dollars, not Novato. And we combine shopping with trips.\nThe Target in Rohnert Park is big, clean and fully stocked and now there's a brand new one in Petaluma that's even nicer.\nWe also eat out a fair amount.\nIt seems Novato only has affordable Mexican restaurants or pizza places, and really expensive trendy restaurants, with almost nothing in between.\nSo we would love to see an \"entertainment complex\" along this corridor; with affordable restaurants, a bowling alley, a roller rink, etc. Someplace where kids and teens can go, along with families, couples on dates and maybe some people from other towns.\nWhy not bring some tax dollars into Novato rather than watching them leave?\nBecky O'Brien, Novato\nReasons to fear fracking\nCalifornians are in for a rude surprise if fracking is allowed to spread across the state.\nI should know; I was raised in Fort Worth and thanks to hydraulic fracturing I can never return to my family home again.\nIn Texas, homeowners don't own the mineral rights on or under their land, so companies came into counties all over the state and drilled the whole neighborhoods.\nMy parents were pushed out of the home they owned for the last 40 years due to the toxic fumes that bubbled up from the ground under their house.\nIf they kept their windows closed, their home would become a combustible bomb from all the gases percolating up from the ground.\nLocal officials warned parents not to let their children play outside, yet it's much worse if they stayed inside. My father had breathing problems and my mother had skin rashes that faded when they visited me in California.\nThey ultimately agreed to walk away from their home and move here.\nThe pollution from fracking isn't confined to well water alone. According to the EPA, it percolates up through the ground and creates a new kind of toxic smog filled with methane and all the chemicals used to fracture the shale that traps the natural gas drillers seek.\nEvidence suggests that earthquake activity is directly linked to fracking and California is prone to large temblors.\nWe should all support Assemblyman Marc Levine and stop hydraulic fracturing in Marin.\nMarla Burke, Kentfield\nA different attitude\nJust finished reading the highlights of touring Tasmania particularly an area called \"The Neck\" a popular tourist destination known for its epicurean contributions to neighboring Australia.\nAmong the major attractions on this strip of land are a cheese factory, vineyard and an oyster farm.\nThree things Marin has in its own backyard and yet, our federal government is doing all it can to dismantle the bivalve component. Ironic, no?\nGeorge Alboff, San Anselmo", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 10"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "I WANT TO RESPOND to inaccuracies in Jim Linford's Dec. 15 Marin Voice column, \"Oysters and wilderness can co-exist.\" Linford distorts the fundamental premise of the Wilderness Act by using the dubious technique of legitimizing one activity because another one of dubious value is permitted as well.\nBy noting livestock grazing and a few other exceptions that were \"grandfathered\" into the Wilderness Act, he tries to make it legal to permit other commercial enterprises like oyster farming to continue. From a purely legal perspective oyster farms have never been authorized by the Wilderness Act   though a small number of other commercial interests like livestock grazing were grandfathered in when the act was legislated. \nTwo wrongs do not make a right. Most ecologists, except those in the employ of the livestock industry, would readily acknowledge that livestock grazing has many negative impacts on the land, whether in wilderness or not. That such a destructive activity like livestock grazing is permitted in the places where we are supposed to be applying the highest standards of natural lands preservation does not make it permissible to indulge another industry like oyster farming.\nAllowing another commercial activity to continue when it clearly has negative ecological impacts on marine ecosystems does not make it OK.\nOne of the many values of wilderness is that it provides us with a \"control\" whereby we can judge how human extraction industries are negatively impacting things like natural marine systems. One of the first principles of science is the need for adequate controls   we have few marine reserves where commercial activities are prohibited. What better place than in a designated wilderness area?\nThe Wilderness Act clearly says that wilderness areas should be managed so as to \"leave them unimpaired for future use as wilderness, and so as to provide for the protection of these areas, the preservation of their wilderness character.\"\nClearly commercial activities like oyster farming are a domestication of the landscape. They distract and diminish the wilderness character, even if they have no known negative ecological impact. Known is an important qualifier. The precautionary principle is that in the absence of knowledge you default towards the goal of \"do no harm.\"\nFurthermore, as a lawyer, Linford knows that the context and the philosophical discussion that goes into the creation of such legislation like the Wilderness Act has much to do with interpretation of legality. The idea behind the Wilderness Act was to limit and reduce, not increase or even legitimize commercial extractive uses.\nFinally the owners of the oyster farm and their supporters conveniently neglect to mention that when these lands were designated as wilderness, the existing oyster farm was given a set period of time to operate when it was understood it would be removed. The Lunny family bought the farm with that knowledge and now appears unwilling to accept those well- known, legally binding legislative terms. Of course they try to dress up their own self-interest as some great social benefit as commercial interests always do.\nBut let us not be fooled. We need wild places more than we need one more oyster farm   especially more wild places in close proximity to urban populations. Removal of the oyster farm is one step towards the goal of restoring wildness to the land.\nIt is a worthy goal and one that the National Park Service should be commended for implementing.\nGeorge Wuerthner is an author who has written about California's wild places, among them California's coast, Yosemite and the Sierra Nevada.

The lack of rain and wind prompted the Bay Area Air Quality Management District to declare \"no burn\" days to help stem air pollution, especially unhealthy particulate matter created by wood fires. \nMany Bay Area residents who had to keep their hearths fire-free grumbled that \"no burn\" days are a product of an over-zealous environmental agency. This winter, we're on track to set a record for the number of Spare the Air days, which has fueled the grumbling, particularly over the holidays.\nThe grumbling also is a product of the air quality agency's problems informing the public about the need for no-burn days and explaining, clearly, the climatic factors that lead the agency to ban fires   even fining those who violate the edict.\nMarin is fortunate that prevailing winds usually blow homegrown pollution out of the county. That doesn't mean that it is Sonoma County's problem, or Sacramento's.\nSpare the Air days are called to not only protect air quality close to home, but where bay and ocean breezes blow the dirty air we generate.\nMarin residents care about the environment and air pollution.\nIn 2010, 78.2 percent of Marin's voters rejected Proposition 23, which sought to repeal clean air objectives of the state anti-global warming initiative. The proposition was defeated with 61.6 percent of the voters statewide refusing to endorse it.\nSpare the Air days are part of a years-long effort to combat air pollution. Smog control and testing for cars and pollution-control rules for smokestack businesses led the way in initiatives that several years ago were expanded to include home fires.\nBesides environmental benefits, these clean-air initiatives benefit people with breathing problems, such as asthma, that are worsened by a layer of wood smoke.\nNo-burn days may mean the fireplace has to remain idle, we have to wear sweaters around the house, add a blanket or two or turn up the heater thermostat, which has its own environmental and financial costs. But it means others can breathe a lot easier.\nFor many, that's more critical than the warmth from a crackling fire in a home's hearth.\nWhile the air quality agency has done a good job of giving public notice of \"no burn\" days, given this likely record-beating season, it would be valuable to do a lot more outreach and clearly explain the climatic reasons for declaring Spare the Air days and specific air-quality benefits that are being achieved.\nThe objective of keeping our skies clear, blue and clean should be universally accepted, but how we try to achieve it is still being debated.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Smoke rises from a chimney in this 2011 photo of a Marin County home.

Marin Sanitary Service, the San Rafael-based curbside pickup company serving much of the county, sends the trees to Marin Resource Recovery, in San Rafael. The trees are put through a grinder to make mulch   a chipped salad of green needles and wood bits.\nThe mulch is then loaded onto trucks and shipped 80 miles to the northeast.\n\"We process them, grind them up with other wood we collect, and then we send it up to Woodland Biomass,\" said Nick Minton, Resource Recovery's facility manager. \"They use it to make electricity.\"\nWoodland Biomass Power, an alternative-fuel power plant about 20 miles outside of Sacramento, uses the mulch to fuel a boiler that produces steam, which generates electricity to power.\nSouthern Marin trees have a different fate. Mill Valley Refuse Service collects the trees and sends them to Redwood Landfill in Novato, where they are turned into organic compost.\n\"It's good for any kind of backyard gardening,\" said Redwood district manager Dan North. \"But most of our compost is used for agriculture.\"\nNorth said most of Redwood's compost is distributed throughout Marin, Napa and Sonoma counties, to wine growers and other local agriculture producers, who regularly get compost from Redwood.\nThe Christmas trees \"are composted like any other feedstock we get,\" North said.\nFor most of the year, Mill Valley Refuse runs six trucks a day, to pick up garbage, recycling and compostable waste. During the several weeks following Christmas, the refuse company sends out eight trucks.\n\"The regular route guys will pick up trees, but they get overloaded,\" Iavarone said. \"So we have other trucks out there picking up the overload. Also, up on Mt. Tam, we have some very narrow streets, so we have some pickup trucks go get those trees.\"\nMost Christmas trees are left on curbs within the first couple weeks of January, but the refuse companies get a few stragglers ever year.\n\"We expect to get the vast majority of them by the end of the month, but we actually have some people who will pull one out in June,\" Iavarone said. \"As long as it's a Christmas tree, we'll take it on (the customers') green-can days.\"\nLocal refuse and waste management brass said it's difficult to get a count on how many trees they pick up, since many of the trees are co-mingled with other trees and yard waste.\nMinton said Resource Recovery handles 15,000 to 20,000 trees. Mill Valley Refuse has 12,000 residential customers; officials were uncertain how many trees the agency picks up.\nWhile Woodland Biomass, which produces electricity for PG&E, receives tens of thousands of Christmas trees every January, the extra fuel translates to little more than a blip on the production radar.\n\"We typically burn about 800 tons of waste wood on a daily basis,\" said Mike Fillmore, Woodland Biomass's operations manager. \"I'm not discounting the Christmas trees ... but it would be difficult to give them any kind of percentage.\"\nContact Laith Agha via email atlagha@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Workers at the Marin Resource Recovery process discarded Christmas trees for recycling on Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2014 in San Rafael, Calif.

But after a rough 0-2 start, the Trojans certainly needed some kind of spark.\nBehind Beau Keeve's 36-point outburst, the Trojans pumped new life into their MCAL season by upending visiting and previously unbeaten in league Novato 76-70 in a thrilling overtime victory.\n\"Now we're back in it,\" Terra Linda coach Steve Farbstein said. \"It could've been disaster if we didn't win this game.\" \nThe Trojans (7-7, 1-2) averted the dreaded 0-3 start by outscoring the Hornets (11-4, 2-1) 12-6 in the four-minute overtime period.\nKirby Dederian provided a big lift for Terra Linda in the extra period. After going scoreless for four quarters, Dederian knocked down a 3-pointer and two clutch free throws in overtime.\n\"Kirby is kind of our fifth-wheel on the offensive end,\" Farbstein said. \"There's other guys who we look to for scoring. But he can knock down a shot when he needs to.\"\nAfter Novato's Josh Broughton   25 points and three assists   scored on an offensive rebound and follow shot to kick off overtime, TL's Keeve sank the front end of a one-and-one free throw, Josh Pinto grabbed the offensive rebound and and Dederian buried the 3-pointer. The Trojans never trailed again.\nIn fact, the Trojans led for most of the contest. Novato took its first lead since the opening 10 seconds of the game at 3:42 of the third period when Andy Velasquez, who had a team-high 27 points, scored inside off a crisp pass from McCoy Wegner.\nThe Hornets played their best in the third when they outscored the Trojans 18-12, but it was the only one of the five periods they posted an edge.\n\"In crunch time, they did a better job than we did,\" Novato coach Andrew Strawbridge said. \"We didn't play very good defense tonight except in the third period. I wish we would've played third quarter defense all game.\"\nBefore the game started, Farbstein worried about his team's ability to rebound with the taller Hornets.\n\"They're a little bigger than us and rebounding has been an issue with us all season,\" Farbstein said.\nOnce the game started, however, forward Josh Pinto did his best to put his coach at ease as he hauled down a game-high 11 rebounds, including eight in the first half when the Trojans built a 36-29 lead.\nNovato's third period comeback was fueled by a technical foul on TL center Zach Able   19 points   who slammed the ball hard into the floor in frustration after his team was called for an offensive foul.\nThe Hornets led by as many as seven points in the third period, but the Trojans finished strong as Keeve scored eight points in the final three minutes of the quarter.\nThe game was nip-and-tuck the rest of the way. Novato led by four with a little more than two minutes remaining until Able canned a pull-up jumper and Keeve drove the lane for a layup to knot the score at 64-64.\nNeither team scored in the final 1:27 of regulation time.\nContact Tim Menicutch via email atsports@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Kirby Dederian of Terra Linda eyes the basket on a fast break during the Trojans' game against Novato in San Rafael, Calif. on Thursday, Jan. 9, 2014.

The Marin Community Alliance, a new group that wants the court to reject the county's plan to meet state housing quotas, filed suit late last year, claiming officials failed to review environmental concerns.\nThe Board of Supervisors, in approving a density program that reaffirms existing development potential, essentially embraced general plan policies in place for years that focus development in the county's \"city-centered corridor\" while preserving rural tracts.\nThe county board's unanimous vote of approval last fall was hailed by housing advocates but condemned by neighborhood activists in Tamalpais Valley, Strawberry and Marinwood.\n\"Recall them all!\" yelled Stephen Nestel at the time. Nestel, founder ofsavemarinwood.org , saying a new video along with housing commentary will be posted on his website, called the county's plan \"an outrageous assault on our communities\" and said the state has endorsed \"an imperial act by an out-of-touch Board of Supervisors.\"\nMost top county officials did not respond to requests for comment beyond a press release that referred questions to principal planner Leelee Thomas. Supervisor Steve Kinsey said he was \"relieved\" at the state action, saying it \"came just in time to protect millions in transportation funds,\" but added \"there remains an important community conversation\" before a housing policy review takes place next year.\nAs it stands, an affordable housing \"overlay\" zone for up to 30 units per acre covers two acres of the Golden Gate Baptist Seminary in Strawberry, a half-acre at Oak Hill School in Marin City, and the 3.5 acres at the St. Vincent's-Silveira tract. It does not increase development potential but focuses on \"clustering\" buildings.\nAlthough not in the overlay zone, policies allow affordable housing elsewhere as well, including the old Chevron station at Tam Junction; Marinwood Plaza, and Grady Ranch. The policies outline potential building sites in unincorporated areas, where the goal is 443 more homes by the end of this year on top of the 330 units planned for since 2007. Overall, 489 of the 773 dwellings in the planning period were designated to accommodate moderate and low income residents.\nState approval of the county program came at the same time it endorsed Novato's housing program. Unlike the county, which approved a 30-unit affordable housing density, Novato officials negotiated densities of from 20 to 23 units an acre.\n\"We took the time to ensure a housing program that reflects the needs and character of our city, and densities more appropriate for Novato,\" said Councilwoman Denise Athas in a statement announcing state approval of city plans.\nSupervisor Judy Arnold noted the state rejected the county's initial submittal of a housing plan that included densities lower than 30 units per acre, and \"in turning in our revised housing element we stayed with 30 units per acre because we had land already zoned for that.\"\nAs for the deal carved out by city officials, \"I believe the acceptance of 23 units per acre that was approved for Novato reflects a change in attitude ... that the county will take advantage of as we move forward with our next housing element,\" Arnold said.\nNels Johnson via email at twitter.com/nelsjohnsonnews", "author": "By Nels Johnson", "title": "State applauds Marin housing plan"}, {"relevance": [149.5], "text": "Friday's local events\nHIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nNorth Bay vs. Voice of Pentecost           3 p.m.           San Rafael\nHIGH SCHOOL BOYS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nNorth Bay vs. Voice of Pentecost           5:30 p.m.           San Rafael\nSaturday's local events \nCOLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nCOM at Merritt           7:30 p.m.           Oakland\nCOLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nCOM at Merritt           5:30 p.m.           Oakland\nHIGH SCHOOL BOYS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nBay Area: MA at Bay           11 a.m.           San Francisco\nBranson at Novato           7:30 p.m.           Novato\nJustin-Siena at Marin Catholic           7:30 p.m.           Kentfield\nRedwood at San Marin           7:30 p.m.           San Marin\nTerra Linda at San Rafael           7:30 p.m.           San Rafael\nDrake at Tam           7:30 p.m.           Mill Valley\nHIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nBay Area: San Domenico vs. Urban           3:30 p.m.           International Bay Area: MA vs. Bay           3:30 p.m.           San Francisco\nRedwood at San Marin           6 p.m.           San Marin\nBranson at Novato           6 p.m.           Novato\nJustin-Siena at Marin Catholic           6 p.m.           Kentfield\nDrake at Tam           6 p.m.           Mill Valley\nTerra Linda at San Rafael           6 p.m.           San Rafael\nHIGH SCHOOL WRESTLING           Time           Place\nRedwood at Clayton Valley Invitational           TBA           Concord San Rafael at TBD tourney           TBD           TBD\nON THE AIR friDAY\nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL           Time           TV           Radio\nRadford at High Point           4 p.m.           ESPNU\nWomen: Stanford at Utah           5 p.m.           P12BA\nWright State at Valparaiso           6 p.m.           ESPNU\nWomen: Cal at Colorado           7 p.m.           P12BA\nWomen: USC at Arizona St.           2 a.m. (Sat.)

He was 67.\nMr. St\u00b8cky lived in San Rafael and Mill Valley from 1983 to 2006, working as a householder priest, designer and landscaper. He was the guiding teacher of the Dharma Eye Zen Center in San Rafael until his death and served as co-leader of the Buddhadharma Sangha meditation group at San Quentin State Prison for many years.\nSusan O'Connell, president of the San Francisco Zen Center, said Mr. St\u00b8cky was a thoughtful man who faced death gracefully, dealing with it directly. She said he had a huge impact on those who knew him. \n\"His commitment was to basically help people all his life and to understand the nature of what it means to be a human being,\" O'Connell said. \"Before he died, he encouraged me to continue to make the difficult decisions that need to be made and not turn away from the pain of those decisions.\"\nMr. St\u00b8cky was born March 6, 1946 in Chicago and grew up in Newton, Kansas with his family of Mennonite farmers. In 1972 he hitchhiked to San Francisco, where he studied Zen at the San Francisco Zen Center for eight years. He studied pastoral counseling at the San Francisco Theological Seminary in San Anselmo and received advanced training in internal family systems psychotherapy.\nIn 2007 Mr. St\u00b8cky became co-abbot of the San Francisco Zen Center, taking up residence at the center's Green Gulch Farm in Muir Beach and teaching others how to farm. He became to first to fill the role of central abbot in 2010 as part of the center's restructuring. He stayed in that role until stepping down last year.\nMr. St\u00b8cky was known as one of the \"fire monks\" who defended the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center in Carmel Valley from the flames of the Basin Complex Fire in Central California in 2008 after firefighters evacuated the area. Author Colleen Busch wrote about Mr. St\u00b8cky's experience in her book \"Fire Monks: Zen Mind Meets Wildfire.\"\nBusch said Mr. St\u00b8cky was a humble and down-to-earth man who trusted his instincts.\n\"He was really independently minded, strong-willed and determined, but he was also incredibly aware of his actions and effect on others,\" Busch said.\nDavid Zimmerman, program director at the San Francisco Zen Center, was one of the fire monks who worked alongside Mr. St\u00b8cky. He said having spiritual leadership present to meet the fire was hugely supportive.\n\"It's not too often you end up going through a difficult life-threatening situation with a teacher,\" Zimmerman said. \"That was quite meaningful and powerful.\"\nBusch, who studied Zen with Mr. St\u00b8cky, said his death has had a huge impact on the community and he will be remembered fondly.\n\"It's heartbreaking for people, but his talks are recorded and saved, so I feel like he's still teaching,\" Busch said.\nAfter being diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer in September, Mr. St\u00b8cky began writing a blog about his personal process of dealing with a terminal illness, which can be viewed online atsubtleeye.sfzc.org .\nHe is survived by his wife Lane Olson, son James Asher, daughter Hannah Dominguez, daughter Robin Williams and four grandchildren.\nA funeral ceremony will be held at 3 p.m. Feb. 9, at Green Dragon Temple at the Green Gulch Farm Zen Center, 1601 Shoreline Highway in Muir Beach.

The Muir Woods National Monument lost $22,000. Statewide, national parks lost $8 million in funding, a 13 percent reduction in funding over the period.\nThe report also noted the economic importance of national parks. A separate 2012 report calculated that visitors to federal parklands provided more than $400 million to Marin communities. Together, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Point Reyes National Seashore and Muir Woods accounted for nearly one-third of the overall $1.3 billion visitors spent in association with national parks in California, according to the peer-reviewed analysis conducted by Michigan State University for the National Park Service.\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Nathan Weaver of Environment California addresses budget impacts to Marin's national parks during a press conference at San Francisco's Crissy Field on Thursday, Jan. 9, 2014.

In 2011, the number was also 60.\nThe data only apply to the state highways and unincorporated roads patrolled by the CHP, said Officer Andrew Barclay.

The show has inspired a line of wines, English teas, several cookbooks and a few blogs for those who want to capture some of the Downton spirit at home.\nBy day, Pamela Foster is a marketing director for a large Toronto law firm, but in her spare time, Foster authors the blog http://downtonabbeycooks.wordpress.com .\nFoster says she and her husband became hooked on \"Downton\" in part because his family line traces back to a similar noble class in England. \"We were watching a show that would have exemplified his family. Mine would have been the downstairs servants,\" Foster says.\nAn amateur culinary historian, Foster saw the food on the show and thought it would be enjoyable to explore and write about it. She began writing about dishes on the show and then used food as a way to study further the history of the day.\n\"It (the blog) really got into connecting people with food and cooking and understanding what meals were served,\" Foster says.\nSo, what would the Crawleys be eating? Everything, according to Foster.\nMost of their food would have been grown on their estate, in their gardens and orchards. Their livestock would have been raised on the estate, which also would have produced their milk and eggs, among other foods.\nBut because of the size and breadth of the British Empire at the time, the family would have had the best of imported foods from all over the world as well   spices from India, tropical foods from Africa and the Caribbean.\nThe cooking, however, would have been decidedly French.\nThe foods that we think of as classically British   stews, meat pies and other hearty pub fare   would have been reserved for feeding the servants, Foster says.\nA family like the Crawleys would likely have eaten four times a day: breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner. The dinners would have been formal, multicourse affairs, but the portions small.\nRoger Thomas, executive chef at the Sheraton Suites Akron/Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, recently finished putting together a \"Downton Abbey\"-themed menu for an upcoming fundraising event for Western Reserve PBS, which airs the series there.\nThomas says he learned a lot about food of the Edwardian era, and used some Downton-inspired cookbooks as guides.\n\"The cuisine was mostly French because that was the standard at the time and they ate well,\" he says.\nThe food, he says, was lavish   big roasts, game or birds such as pheasant, quail, duck or goose. The presentation, however, was not. No large presentations were made at the table. Rather, all of the carving was done downstairs and the foods were presented on silver platters by servants.\n\"Everything was served to you. Nothing was sliced at the table, it was all done in the kitchen,\" he says.\nThe cooking would have used a lot of animal fat, such as lard and rendered duck fat. It also was heavy with rich sauces.\nHors d'oeuvres were popular: caviar, stuffed mushrooms, savory tarts and oysters would have been typical, Thomas says.\nA soup course and fish course followed, before the main entree of meat or fowl. \"They ate a lot more kinds of birds for sure   partridge and pheasant. The cuts of beef were pretty much the same and a lot of the fishes were the same. We have more fishes available to us these days. They would have eaten a lot of cod or Dover sole,\" Thomas says.\nFor viewers who may want to throw a Downton-inspired dinner party, Thomas says it doesn't have to be a formal sit-down affair.\nAnyone who watches the show knows Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, played by Maggie Smith, gets in some of her best lines over tea.\nRECIPES\nCaviare with smoked salmon\nMakes 1 serving\nSmoked salmon\n1 jar caviare (caviar)\nChopped gherkins\nChervil\nLemon\nTarragon vinegar\nCut the salmon into very thin slices - allow one small slice per person.

It stands to reason that some of them would be in Marin County, where Shepard lived when he was playwright in residence at San Francisco's Magic Theatre in the 1970s and early '80s.\nThe latest is \"Fool for Love,\" Shepard's 1983 portrait of torrid codependency and family secrets, which AlterTheater is presenting in repertory with the world premiere production of Marisela Trevi\u00d2o Orta's play \"The River Bride\" in a downtown San Rafael storefront. Both plays will move to American Conservatory Theater's Costume Shop Theater in San Francisco for a short run Feb. 11 to 16, immediately after closing in Marin. \nThe AlterTheater production is directed by Will Marchetti, an associate artist with the company who played the Old Man in the original production of \"Fool for Love\" at the Magic, directed by Shepard himself. Veteran local actor Charles Dean now plays the omnipresent Old Man, who sits in a chair drinking and chortling and watching the action intently, though the others seldom acknowledge or even seem to see or hear him. What can this mean? Well, obviously we'll find out, though the fact that Selina Young's lights change whenever he talks may be a clue.\nWhat he's observing is a whole lot of drama between a longtime on-again, off-again couple tied together by a deep dark secret that we'll also hear about at length before the story's done. Matt Lai is compelling in his volatile moods as Eddie, a rugged, drunken cowboy who apparently keeps running out on the woman, May, for long periods of time and then coming back like nothing happened. Company cofounder Jeanette Harrison is a fury of contradictions as May, who affects blas\u00c8, tough-as-nails indifference when Eddie's in the room and collapses into a heap of despair almost every time he leaves it. She's miserable with him and miserable without him.\nBoth are awfully jealous and possessive about each other, though he keeps disappearing and she says she wants to be rid of him. There's always an explicitly stated threat of violence, but it's not one you really take seriously because the damage these two inflict (and suffer from) is emotional. Danny Jones arrives late as Martin, a wide-eyed and amusingly dim naif who thinks he's taking May on a movie date and gets a lot more than he bargained for.\nIt all takes place in a motel room barely suggested by a rumpled bed, a few chairs and a floor lamp. (There's no set to speak of, but Wiljago Cook is credited as \"space consultant.\") Will McCandless' minimal sound design adds occasional noises of loud and disturbing things going on outside. Everybody's rumpled and disheveled (at least until Martin gets there), and Janice Koprowski's character-appropriate costumes involve a lot of plaid shirts.\nIt's a short play, just an hour and 15 minutes, but that's about the right length after the long, dreamy expanses of expository speeches, which is one of the few places that the energy drags in Marchetti's bare-bones staging. It's interesting that the most perplexing part is when the role Marchetti originated finally has his moment in the play, despite Dean's reliably strong performance. When the two sometime lovers tell their competing stories about what happened in the past, the two accounts seem perfectly complementary, not contradictory at all, which makes the Old Man's vociferous objection to one side of the story seem hard to fathom. They aren't different versions so much as different chapters, more or less in agreement. Although it loses some steam toward the end, it's a fascinating play with a lot to love in it, even if sometimes   like the folks in the motel   you may wish you didn't.\nSam Hurwitt's theater blog, The Idiolect, is atwww.theidiolect.com .

Both San Rafael and the county received A grades.\nAt the bottom of the scorecard are Belvedere and Corte Madera, which received failing grades, followed by San Anselmo with a D. Fairfax, Ross and Tiburon all received a C. Two other Marin cities   Larkspur and Novato   received B's. \nPam Granger, a lung association spokeswoman, said Marin's scores likely haven't changed from 2013 because it takes about two years to pass new policies and get public health groups involved in advocating for change. Plus, many of the county's municipalities are already doing good work.\n\"It takes so long for a policy to develop and Marin is in a unique position. There's a good combo of science and political will that has caused Marin to be one of the strongest counties in the state,\" Granger said.\nBut that doesn't mean more can't be done   especially in Belvedere and Corte Madera.\n\"There's still room for elected officials to join in and save some lives,\" Granger said.\nEach jurisdiction is judged on three categories: smoke-free outdoor air, smoke-free housing and reducing sales of tobacco products. While most municipalities received A's in the first two categories, six received F's for their efforts   or lack thereof   in reducing sales of tobacco products. Only Mill Valley, San Rafael and the county received A's for efforts to reduce tobacco sales.\nRoss was the only town to see a small change in its grade, receiving two more points than it did last year in the smoke-free outdoor air category for the dining division.\nBelvedere adopted its smoke-free ordinance in 1993, but hasn't made any changes since then. The ordinance prohibits smoking in enclosed public spaces, but doesn't address outdoor spaces.\nBelvedere City Manager Mary Neilan said the small city has no commercial centers, two small parks and no real opportunities for future housing developments. She said smoking in apartment complexes hasn't been an issue the council has addressed.\n\"We have some multifamily housing apartments, but I haven't heard any concern or complaints from those residents,\" Neilan said.\nCorte Madera's smoke-free ordinance was adopted in 1981 and updated in 2012. It prohibits smoking in enclosed public places, town parks and playgrounds, but doesn't address housing.\nCorte Madera Mayor Michael Lappert said he personally doesn't believe the town should regulate smoking in people's homes.\n\"The idea that I'm going to tell someone not to do something that's legal in their own backyard is ridiculous,\" Lappert said.\nBut Corte Madera Councilwoman Carla Condon said she's asked the Town Council to consider a more stringent ordinance within the next month or so that addresses smoking in multifamily housing units.\n\"I already have in hand sample ordinances from Larkspur and San Rafael,\" Condon said. \"We're taking a proactive position in beginning discussions to move in that direction.\"\nDespite zero changes in overall jurisdictional grades, San Rafael did implement the last phase of its smoking ban in November 2013. Smokers are no longer allowed to light up in apartments or any other residential units that share a common wall. The city adopted its smoking ban in October 2012, first prohibiting smoking at parks, bus stops restaurant patios and other outdoor spaces.\nThe county adopted a similar ordinance in May 2012, but it allows landlords and condominium boards to seek smoking exemptions for up to 20 percent of housing units. The same goes for an ordinance adopted by Larkspur in 2010.\nSan Rafael has led the charge in adopting smoke-free housing policies, and San Rafael City Councilman Damon Connolly said he's grateful for the associations' recognition.\n\"These policies came about because we heard extensively from our local community that this was something important to them,\" Connolly said. \"We're finding the ordinance has been well received locally.\"\nThis year it is Tiburon's turn to implement the last phase of its smoke-free housing ordinance. Landlords have until July 1 before all existing multi-unit complexes in Tiburon must be completely non-smoking. All new complexes are already smoke-free.\nMarin jurisdictions scored much better than the state of California as a whole, according to the association's report, as the state is falling behind in protecting people from the harmful effects of tobacco. While the state earned an A grade for smoke-free air policies, it received a D for its low cigarette tax, an F for failing to adequately fund tobacco prevention and control programs, and another F for poor coverage of smoking cessation and treatment services.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

The IJ agrees that Levine's turnabout \"looks a little clumsy.\"\nHowever, the problem isn't that Levine turned on a dime gracelessly, but that he did so at all. Levine had written about the perceived need for a moratorium well before the vote. Since every bill requires specific legislative findings, the bill's sponsors could reasonably assume that colleagues who also voted for it eventually accepted those findings as a sensible blueprint for California's energy future.\nActually, it was merely a tactical step. The real agenda   stopping all fracking in the state forever   didn't remain hidden for long. Levine's 'moratorium' purports to be a mere timeout, pending, in the IJ's words, further study of \"potential impacts on groundwater supply, climate change, disposal of wastewater ... and potential seismic activity.\"\nGiven Levine's recent history, is there any reason to take this rationale at face value? Isn't it more likely that he'll simply keep moving the goalposts, with the intention of stopping all fossil fuel energy production in the state?\nIf it is true that drilling into California's deep shale reserve could produce as many as 2.8 million jobs in California by 2020, and boost the economy by 14 percent, Levine and like-minded colleagues could at least be more forthcoming about how else they intend to grow the state's economy and maintain appropriate energy production.\nThe legislative process requires at least a minimal level of good faith. Levine may be cementing a few friendships here in Marin with his tactics on the fracking issue, but he is hardly inspiring the trust and confidence of colleagues in other parts of the state.\nSteve Stein, Larkspur\nSheriff should form panel\nI can think of no downside to setting up a citizens' advisory council to collaborate with Sheriff Robert Doyle.\nIn fact, I was surprised when he did not respond favorably to the idea when it was first proposed.\nAnd, on the upside, there is the potential for an increased flow of positive regard between Marin City and the county, which might bring a reduction in incidents between Marin City's youth and law enforcement.\nIndeed, the entire community is deserving of equal respect with the rest of the county. Respect and support are the glue that brings everyone into a thriving and empowered community.\nSheriff Doyle should know that the task of an advisory council would be to respect and support him as well.\nLorrie Norby, Mill Valley\nShow us the money?\nIn reference to the San Rafael Bicycle/Pedestrian Master Plan 2011 Update, when the City Council withdrew the Civic Center Priority Development Area designation, Damon Connolly committed the council to \"leaving no stone unturned\" to replace the funding we lost.\nThat funding was slated for bicycle and pedestrian improvements to the station area. The immediate replacement need is $650,000, based on funding that was already promised, but for which we no longer qualify.\nIn the next three years, the funding loss could be several million dollars.\nThe City Council should advise the public on the status of the funding replacement.\nGail Napell, San Rafael", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 23"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "An X Games-like bike jump course near Mill Valley has drawn the attention of the likes of Tiburon Olympic Gold Medalist Jonny Moseley. One problem: County parks officials say it was built illegally.\nThe series of a dozen or so undulating earthen hills near Vasco Court apparently took years to build, and was discovered by Marin County Parks and Open Space rangers only recently.\nBecause the handmade course is so developed and near spotted owl and red-legged frog habitat   both species are federally listed under the Endangered Species Act   officials believe it would take an environmental permit to bring it back to its natural condition. \n\"The first time I saw this, I was like 'oh my God,'\" said ranger Robert Ruiz as he looked over the site this week. \"How did they do this?\"\nCounty officials point to the bike course as one of many examples of rogue uses of public lands. Illegal trails crisscross the thousands of acres of county open space, said Linda Dahl, director and general manager of the district. Bikers and hikers use tools to carve out trails, but in the process damage the habitat of flora and fauna.\n\"We just can't keep adding trails and trails, or pretty soon the open space looks like a plate of spaghetti,\" she said.\nThe county is in the process of developing a plan to manage roads and trails on 16,000 acres of county open space preserves. It will be reviewed Thursday by the parks commission.\nThe plan covers 34 county open space preserves that are crossed by 270 miles of trails and roads, including 113 miles of fire roads and 335 trailheads. It tightens restrictions, outlines a decision-making matrix that sorts priorities for projects and sets up a series of visitor management zones in which a variety of strategies regulate activity.\nIt got criticized from some who felt the county was overstepping its bounds by trying to regulate trails.\n\"People have been building trails in Marin County since these hills were ranched and people believe it's their birthright to do so,\" Dahl said. \"We are concerned about rogue trails; they are very destructive for the environment. We understand people like to get out into nature, but if you build whatever you want wherever you want, pretty soon that nature is gone.\"\nThe county parks plan would give amnesty to any trail built before November 2011 with a promise that the practice would stop, Dahl said. Each county preserve would be examined, however, and if a trail was deemed unfit for the area or unsafe it would be removed, she added.\nRanger Ruiz said the bike course near Mill Valley is a prime example.\n\"See these wood rat nests?\" he said, pointing to a wooded clump near one of the bike ramps. \"That's what the spotted owls feed on. Having this bike area so close to habitat is problematic.\"\nThe bike course is a popular enough location to have drawn the interest of Olympian Moseley, who did a piece on the site as part of \"Bikeskills.com : Adventures Part II,\" which was posted to YouTube. After this article was published, the status of the video was changed to private.\nIn another county area, 67 trees were felled by people who built an illegal 2.5-mile mountain bike trail at French Ranch Preserve in the San Geronimo Valley. There is also vandalism. On Ring Mountain in Corte Madera, signs posted to keep people out of a burned area were picked up and thrown behind a pile of rocks. Other signs have been similarly damaged in county open space.\n\"A lot of this goes on at night when we are not there,\" said Brian Sanford, superintendent with Marin County parks. \"It's a game of cat and mouse.\"\nIt's not only county parks that have issues with illegal trails.\nLast month a lengthy downhill mountain bike trail   complete with wooden ramps, bridges, and jumps   carved out through bay oak woodland and eucalyptus groves was discovered in the Tamalpais Valley off the Miwok Trail, said Frank Dean, superintendent at the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.\n\"It was elevated in places with boardwalks and jumps; it took quite awhile to build,\" Dean said. \"It was pretty bold.\"\nDahl said the county plans to step up enforcement. It recently hired nine new rangers and among their duties will be to keep an eye out for illegal trails.\n\"People tell us who are we to stop these trails,\" Dahl said. \"We are hired by the public to steward these lands.\"\nContact Mark Prado via email at mprado@marinij.com\nif you go\nThe Marin County Parks and Open Space Commission meets at 2:30 p.m. Thursday at the Civic Center to get an update on the trails management plan.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Marin County Parks and Space photo A stash of signs aimed to protect a burned area on Ring Mountain were dumped behind rocks by vandals.

The citizens who voted chose our new council members and voted in a 20-year sales tax increase. \nSan Rafael touts itself as a big city within Marin County. It needed those wins because it has big-city problems   homelessness, revitalization of the downtown, pensions, limited financial resources, core service priorities and a $20 million debt for the SMART train overpass.\nIJ columnist Dick Spotswood opined that Mayor Gary Phillips' handpicked slate of candidates prevailed. The mayor and the new council members are to be congratulated both in their campaigns and in the election results.\nThat being said, a city council is like an athletic team, its members need to work together, not for the win, but for the greater good of those whom they serve.\nIn one of the mayor's robo-calls, he spoke of electing individuals to be part of a team. Team is the operative word because a continual stream of new members is essential in a team's success and survival.\nWithout new \"players,\" novel ideas hatch less often, energy wanes, the collective strength of the unit is not what it used to be.\nSome people believe San Rafael suffers from sameness   Planning Commission to City Council, no turnover until an incumbent retires. Those individuals say look no further than this election cycle to support those facts.\nBoth of San Rafael's two new council members are former planning commissioners who bring their own unique traits, qualities and idiosyncrasies to the council.\nThe new members have an opportunity to be two of the firsts.\nMaribeth Bushey Lang's campaign literature spoke of only five women ever serving on the City Council. The IJ endorsed Kate Colin and Bushey Lang and emphasized their gender would bring balance to the council. Women as politicians, as school board and commission members, as council members and legislators can and do make a difference.\nAll government is better served by their participation.\nColin stated that she looked forward to working hard and to making a big difference. Colin and Bushey Lang can make a difference   a big difference   by being on the cutting edge of a pledge because terms limits are on their way in Marin County politics.\nMill Valley already has the informal pledge protocol.\nAs a \"Big City,\" San Rafael needs to set the example. San Rafael can show the rest of the county that for those who believe the Mission City suffers from sameness, it is no longer business as usual. And the City Council because of its balance can make that happen and informally pledge that if elected, they will only serve two four-year terms.\nSounds good to this writer.

Any city within such a county   such as Yolo, El Dorado, and Placer counties   would be considered suburban by the state if the city has a population of less than 100,000, except for Roseville. \nLevine, D-San Rafael, said the proposed legislation emerged from discussions with local government officials, affordable housing advocates and community leaders to make sure Marin's future housing developments aren't dense like they are in Southern California, and fit into the community.\n\"For years Marin has been dealing with a metropolitan designation that calls for a certain level of density,\" Levine said. \"We want something that respects the characteristics of Marin County.\"\nMarin was designated as a metropolitan area in 2004 and is required by the state to set aside land in its housing element to accommodate future growth and low-income residents. The state approved the county's updated housing element in December, which plans for 30-unit-per-acre developments.\nUnder AB 1537, Marin's minimum housing density would drop from 30 units per acre to 20. Many Marin residents have expressed outrage at proposals to build 30-unit-per-acre developments, such as the 180-unit Tamal Vista apartment complex being built in Corte Madera at the former WinCup site. Eighteen of the complex's market-rate apartments will be set aside for low-income residents.\nCounty Supervisor Judy Arnold said Marin has been trying to get a bill like AB 1537 passed for the past three or four years, but it was never scheduled for committee hearings. She said she and Supervisor Susan Adams have been meeting with affordable housing advocates in Sacramento to request the groups don't oppose the bill.\nArnold said there's hope this time around as advocates seem to understand that Marin County isn't opposed to affordable housing, but wants it done in a way that translates to less-massive complexes.\n\"We just don't want to have to see it at 30 units per acre because that's just not who we are,\" Arnold said. \"I think we all have great hopes this will be passed through.\"\nLevine said the bill is supported by the county of Marin, Non-Profit Housing Association of Northern California, Bridge Housing, Eden Housing, EAH Housing and Center for Sustainable Neighborhoods.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

The first World War was especially so. Most of the crowned heads of Europe were closely related; mutual distrust and animosity led to an arms buildup that resulted in the deaths of millions. With repercussions still apparent today, it was the ultimate family squabble   one that for years kept men in squalid stinking trenches that \"stretched from the North Sea to Switzerland,\" in the words of James Dunn, director of R.C. Sherriff's \"Journey's End,\" now at Ross Valley Players.\nA Marine Corps veteran, Dunn understands that soldiers generally aren't motivated by hatred for the enemy   they are lured into service with the promise of adventure and financial gain, and are kept in line through ingrained feelings of loyalty and incredibly effective peer pressure. Adherence to a strict chain of command makes officers relay and follow orders issued by those above them even when they have doubts about chances for success. Personal relationships make for deeply complicated circumstances in battle situations. \n\"Journey's End\" opens against this background. Set in a British officers' dugout near the front lines in France, it depicts the boredom and anxiety of men awaiting a German attack. The war's long periods of tedium are leavened by humor and offset by moments of absolute terror and panic, a reality conveyed with conviction by Dunn's expert nine-man cast. The performance is a respectful and deeply felt treatment of Sherriff's script, one of a handful of realistic literary works that came out of World War I, including Erich Maria Remarque's classic \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" one of the first books to be burned when the Nazis came to power in 1933.\n\"Journey's End\" focuses on the relationship between Capt. Stanhope (David Yen) and 2nd Lt. Raleigh (Francis Serpa), former boyhood friends now in an unimaginably stressful life-or-death situation. Stanhope has been given orders to send out a raiding party to capture one or more German prisoners. With visible pain and resignation he assigns Raleigh and another friend, Lt. Osborne (Tom Hudgens) to lead the raid, knowing it is a suicide mission. All who have relayed the orders, from the unnamed colonel (Steve Price) on down, know they are issuing death warrants to volunteers, but cannot refuse their duty.\nThis production might be unrelentingly depressing were it not for many bright bits of humor spouted by several officers. Steven Deitz, who also did a spectacular job with sound design, is rock-solid in the role of battle-weary but upbeat 2nd Lt. Trotter. Sean Gunnell is wonderful as the officers' good-natured cook Pvt. Mason.\nIt's nearly impossible to heap enough praise on the ingenuity of set designer Ron Krempetz. The dugout's stained and straining timbers provide scant protection against the horrors outside the walls. Krempetz's claustrophobic man-made cave is one of the few that's ever used the low overhang of the Barn's stage to advantage.\nBeautifully paced, brilliantly staged and perfectly cast, RVP's \"Journey's End\" is a rare gem, one that succeeds in conveying its author's sobering intent through straightforward factual delivery.

I have flaws, and I accept responsibility,\" said Herve, 42, of San Francisco. \"I am not Jesus Christ. I'm a sinner.\" \nBoth victims spoke in court about the devastation Herve caused to their finances, their families and their sense of trust. Wold, speaking directly at Herve, called him a \"narcissistic career criminal.\"\n\"You are neither blessed, nor marvelous, nor have any honor,\" said Wold, 70, who occasionally choked back tears during her statement.\nEngel, 69, told the judge he felt \"shame\" and \"self-loathing\" for falling victim to Herve.\n\"This guy did not commit one crime, he committed tens of crimes,\" he said. \"I am penniless. This guy stole everything.\"\nHerve pleaded guilty to wire fraud for the scam, which lasted from 2006 until 2012. The fraud began when Herve responded to an advertisement that Engel, a longtime Marin County real estate broker, had placed for a $6 million property in Tiburon.\nHerve claimed he was the son of Denis Nguesso, president of the Republic of Congo, and that his father was looking to buy expensive homes in the Bay Area. But before any deals could be done, Herve needed advance money to overcome a series of legal and financial hurdles, including the U.S. government's supposed freezing of $43 million of his assets.\nResponding to one money request after another, Engel gave Herve $600,000 in savings over a period of several years, including a $100,000 inheritance from his mother.\nWhen that money was gone, Engel asked Wold, his girlfriend, to contribute more money. Herve claimed that unless he prevailed in a classified federal court case he could not discuss, then he would be unable to recover his $43 million, and thus would be unable to pay Engel back.\nWold, a retired schoolteacher who is now 70 years old, agreed to help. She lost about $950,000 before the couple reported Herve to authorities.\nHerve was finally arrested by the FBI last spring. Under the plea deal, prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed to a sentencing range of 33 to 41 months.\nHerve was sentenced Wednesday before U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco. Herve's defense attorney, Jay Nelson, tried to soften the sentence by citing Herve's past hardships, including the alleged massacre of his family during political upheaval in Africa.\nBreyer rejected the argument, noting that millions of people are killed in political violence, but \"don't then go out and bilk people out of $1.6 million.\"\nNelson also said Herve was found with hundreds of lottery tickets when he was arrested, a sign that he was desperately trying to make the victims whole.\nBreyer said it was the first time in 16 years on the bench a defendant had tried to use lottery ticket purchases as a mitigation tactic. He said the only good thing that might be said about buying lottery tickets was that Herve was \"supporting education in the state of California.\"\n\"With other people's money,\" he added. \"Let's not get too mushy about it.\"\nContact Gary Klien via email atgklien@marinij.com orhttps://twitter.com/GaryKlien\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Karen Wold stands in front of the Phillip Burton Federal Building & United States Courthouse on Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2014, in San Francisco, Calif.

At Redwood High in the late 1990s he won two MCAL titles, two black shirts in the Dipsea Race and then went on to compete in track and cross country for the University of Pennsylvania. Then, he tried cycling and signed with the high-level professional team Rock Racing. Now, Johnson's trying his hand as team director. Last year, the former Belvedere resident founded a youth development cycling squad that recently became one of only 10 teams in the U.S. licensed with the UCI (International Cycling Union).\nJohnson, who just moved back from the East Coast to San Francisco, is optimistic that this effort will be his most successful. \n\"I could accomplish a lot more with a group than I ever could by myself,\" he said.\nJohnson's D3Devo team   which stands for Division 3 Development   is made up of 13 riders all under the age of 25. The plan is to give the young riders a chance to compete at national and high level UCI races   something Johnson saw lacking when he tried cycling his way up through the ranks. Of course, Johnson would have been too old for his own team by the time he was cycling competitively.\nAs a kid, Johnson hung out at an old bike shop in The Cove shopping center in Tiburon and did his first mountain bike race when he was 11-years old. But, running took precedence in high school and then college. It wasn't until after he graduated from Penn that Johnson dove back into cycling while working in real estate.\n\"I completely fell in love with riding again,\" he said.\nHe attracted the attention of the international-level team Rock Racing at the end of 2009. This was his shot at the big time, Johnson thought. He moved back to Marin to live in Sausalito and train. But, then, the team went bankrupt in April 2010.\nJohnson decided, then, to start his own team, Champion System, with a few bankers. But, there was a difference of opinion about what they should be focusing on   youth riders or not.\n\"It really wasn't the right kind of fit,\" Johnson said.\nInstead, he tried again and founded a second team last year. The D3Devo team grew from just a handful of kids to over a dozen. They raced in national-level races like the Philly Cycling Classic, the Nature Valley Grand Prix and the Cascade Cycling Classic. And, they did well, taking podium spots and titles. Griffin Easter, who had never done a national race before joining the team, was fourth at last year's San Rafael Twilight Criterium.\nThis year, Johnson had bigger plans. He filed to become a UCI-licensed team and was accepted, which required an auditing process, a budget of a certain size and results to back up his goals.\nMarin Bikes, based in Novato, also signed on to sponsor the D3Devo team. It's the only professional road cycling team the company sponsors and the highest level team it supports. In part, it appreciated the local ties the team had.\n\"Chris grew up here, riding here,\" said Tsering Alleyne, marketing manager for Marin Bikes. \"He has a special connection to the area and to the brand.\"\nThe D3Devo team is headed to Marin in February for training camp. Five of the guys will live here for two months to put in hundreds of miles and take advantage of Marin's cycling options. They'll also put on organized rides with Marin Bikes.\n\"It's one of the best places to train in the world,\" Johnson said.\nAnd, being young kids, they're just as excited about hanging out in the city as they are about the training grounds.\n\"I've heard great things about San Francisco sushi, which I'm particularly excited about,\" said Justin Mauch, 19, who will be coming straight from the U23 USA Cycling national team training camp.\nJohnson doesn't have time to actually ride, himself, anymore. He's too busy managing the team, organizing races and planning for his ultimate goal: eventually getting into the Tour of California or the USA Pro Challenge. For their part, Mauch and his teammates are putting in 30 hours a week on the bike, in between classes and jobs.\n\"How can you not be inspired by that,\" Johnson said.\nNovato committee seat\nNovato is looking to fill a vacant seat on its Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee. The committee works with the city and Dept. of Public Works on implementing Novato's Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan and bike/pedestrian infrastructure.\nApplications can be found online atwww.cityofnovato.org and are due at the end of the business day on Friday.\nSan Bruno Hill Climb\nThe cycling season and the new year kicked off with the Jan. 1 San Bruno Hill Climb. And, Marin cyclists kicked off their years with wins and podium finishes.\nTanya Frederick, from San Anselmo, won the women's Category 3/4 race and Mill Valley's Bingo McKenzie won the men's Category 4 race. Hans Gouwens, of Corte Madera, took second in the Masters 45+ Category 1/2/3 race, while teammate Gardie Jackson, of Larkspur, was sixth.\nKelly O'Mara is a repo\nrter, triathlete, and sometime cyclist.

The law should have required dispensing of marijuana be handled by pharmacies and pharmacists, but because federal law considers marijuana a \"Schedule 1\" drug, established pharmacies are outlawed from being part of a solution.\nSo, they've been replaced by storefront operations, some of which appear and vanish depending on the heat they get from local government.\nThis cat-and-mouse routine has been going on for nearly 18 years.\nThe dilemma has been worsened by swings in federal enforcement, from looking the other way to threatening landlords of pot shops that government would confiscate their property.\nIn San Rafael, Caregiver Compassion Group opened on Woodland Avenue in San Rafael after losing its lease in Sausalito.\nThe group says its San Rafael office was a business office where it processed prescriptions and arranged deliveries. No \"medicine\" was onsite, its leaders say.\nOfficially, with the city shutting down the Caregiver Compassion Group's San Rafael office, there remains only one legal dispensary in Marin   Marin Holistic Solutions in Corte Madera. The town decided the dispensary would have to go after its lease expires this summer.\nLocal bans leave the people in limbo. Those are the people voters wanted to help with their overwhelming approval of the 1996 measure. How compassionate is it to force people for whom marijuana helps their health problems to drive long distances to get it or get it from a street-corner dealer?\nToday, the political trend appears to be headed toward legalization.\nLegalized pot measures have won approval in Colorado and Washington and another initiative is headed for California's ballot later this year.\nA recent Field Poll shows that 55 percent of California voters now favor legalization, making it legal for anyone over 21.\nVoters nationwide are ready to take this issue into their own hands. They aren't waiting for federal, state and local officials to reach a consensus.\nIn California, voters already have given them that chance.\nThe permit flap in San Rafael is just another example that there is no political willingness or leadership to provide reasonable, safe and local access to compassionate use of medical marijuana.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Berta Bollinger and Donald Hatt are co-presidents of Caregiver Compassion Group - a nonprofit medical marijuana cooperative with about 300 members. Their office space out of which they were operating a medical marijuana delivery service was closed down by the city of San Rafael effective Jan. 6.

Putting a bucket in the shower? It's time to dust off those tips, as California finds itself in a brutally dry spell. On Friday, following the lowest rainfall year in the state's 153-year history, and with the Sierra snow pack at 17 percent of normal, Gov. Jerry Brown called a drought emergency and asked California residents to cut their water use by 20 percent.\nThat's not so difficult, experts say. Fixing leaks in household faucets and toilets, and reducing lawn irrigation can get most families to the goal. \n\"It's pretty easy to save 20 percent. You want to remember that your plants   even with it being dry outside   are not needing as much water this time of year because it is cooler than in the summer,\" said Chris Brown, former executive director of the California Urban Water Conservation Council, a nonprofit group in Sacramento. \"The easiest way to save water is to save it outdoors.\"\nIn California, more than 50 percent of residential water use occurs outdoors. A typical lawn consumes about 57 inches of rain a year, according to the Association of California Water Agencies. Rain quenches some of that thirst, but it's not enough in most places. Both San Jose and Los Angeles receive 15 inches of rain in a normal year, for example, but last year each received barely 3 inches.\nSprinklers make up the difference. A small lawn of 1,000 square-feet takes about 35,000 gallons of water per year, according to the association. Many homeowners over-water, particularly in the winter, and end up using twice that amount.\nWater agencies around the Bay Area offer rebates to replace grass with more drought-tolerant plants. The East Bay Municipal Utility District, for example, pays 50 cents a square foot to people who replace lawns with native, drought-tolerant landscaping, up to $2,500 a yard. The Santa Clara Valley Water District pays $1 per square foot.\n\"If you aren't really going to use a lawn there are a lot of options, like native grasses and wildflowers, succulents and other plants,\" said Ruthie Gordon, co-owner of Mazingira Gardening Services, a Berkeley landscaping company that specializes in replacing grass lawns, installing drip irrigation and other water-saving strategies.\n\"Some people think they must have a lawn. It's a cultural thing,\" she said. \"But you really only need a lawn if you have kids or animals playing on it, or if you throw a lot of parties. If it's just for aesthetics, there are a lot of options that look great.\"\nThe average home in California uses 192 gallons of water a day, according to a 2008 study by the state Department of Water Resources and the Urban Water Conservation Council.\nAmong other tips that experts recommend:\n  Taking a 5-minute shower instead of a 10-minute shower saves 12.5 gallons with a low-flow shower head, and 25 gallons with a standard 5 gallon-per-minute shower head.\n  Turning the faucet off while brushing teeth or shaving saves about 10 gallons a day.\n  Using a broom to clean driveways, sidewalks and patios instead of a hose saves 8-18 gallons a minute.\n  Fixing the worn washers in a faucet with a slow steady drip saves 350 gallons per month, and 2,000 gallons a month if the leak is a small stream. Putting a new flapper in a leaking toilet can save 7,000 gallons a month. To test for leaks, put food coloring in the tank. Don't flush. Ten minutes later if you see color in the bowl, you have a leak.\n  Installing a water-efficient clothes washer saves up to 16 gallons a load. A water-efficient dishwasher saves up to 8 gallons a load. Rebates are available for water-saving appliances at most Bay Area water agencies.\n  Soak pots and pans instead of letting the water run while scraping them clean.\n  Most Bay Area water agencies offer free water use inspections. An expert will come to your house check for leaks and offer tips on how to save water and lower your water bill.\n  Replacing a pre-1990 toilet, which can use 5 gallons per flush, with a newer high-efficiency model can save 38 gallons a day per toilet. Most Bay Area water districts offer rebates of between $50 and $250 per toilet.\n\"People need a lot of help,'' said Whitney Gravel, a Burlingame resident who has been looking for water-saving tips following the governor's drought declaration.\n\"We take our access to clean water for granted,\" she said. \"We need to reorient our thinking to conserve. We need to do it always, but now it's even more critical.\"\nPaul Rogers covers resources and environmental issues. Contact him at 408-920-5045.

If that's what it takes to debunk this well-intentioned fantasy, then it's money well spent. \nProponents claim Marin once had a network of local-serving streetcars and that this new effort is simply restoring something that once was.\nAs an old pro-rail advocate, I hate to be the wet blanket. A glance at Marin's transportation history shows that our county never had a single streetcar.\nUntil 1940, it did have fine suburban electric trains, mostly designed to bring commuters from Fairfax, San Rafael and Mill Valley to the Sausalito ferry. It enabled workers to travel to their jobs in San Francisco's Financial District from Marin homes.\nIts successor is Golden Gate Transit's excellent ferry and commuter bus system.\nEven during the relatively auto-free early 20th century, streetcars never made sense in Marin.\nStreetcars, unlike suburban railroads such as Marin's old NWP, usually make stops every two or three blocks, operate on frequent headways and share with autos and buses the use of rail tracks embedded in street pavement.\nStreetcars are simply not the appropriate modality for even medium-dense suburbs like Contra Costa, San Mateo or eastern Alameda counties.\nOf course, SMART isn't anything like a streetcar. It's a commuter train primarily designed to bring Sonoma commuters to Marin jobs.\nTransit professionals understand that buses, perhaps even the next generation of electric buses, are far more appropriate if the goal is simply enhanced public transit.\nThe only logical rationale for building a Ross Valley streetcar line is to encourage high-density residential apartments around every potential streetcar stop.\nThat would certainly satisfy the Association of Bay Area Governments' criteria for high-density \"transit-centered development\" all along the trolley's route. That, for better or worse, would ease the way for a dramatic transformation of the Ross Valley into a small-time version of Concord.\nEven that level of big-time real estate development wouldn't create sufficient density for a streetcar line to make any financial or operational sense. It would make some developers and allied interest groups wealthy.\nlll\nTHE RACE for state Assembly from the Marin-Southern Sonoma 10th District is heating up.\nDemocrat Marc Levine will seek a second term.\nMarin Community College Trustee Diana Conti announced before Christmas that she'll challenge Levine. Conti, also a Democrat, is expected to have major support from public employee unions still bitter over Levine's 2012 upset of former assemblyman and labor leader Michael Allen.\nA third Democrat, Santa Rosa's freshman council member Erin Carlstrom, has now joined the fray. Carlstrom's first big endorsement is from the formidable California Nurses Association.\nThere will also be at least one conservative Republican in the race. Greg Allen, a member of Marin's Republican Central Committee, plans to run.\nThe 10th AD race falls under the top-two electoral system.\nRegardless of party, the top two finishers in the June first round will face off in November's general election.\nPresumably one of the finalists will be Levine. The big question is which of the others makes the runoff.\nFiling for the post opens on Feb. 10 and closes on March 7.\nThat's the same schedule for all local seats up for election on the June 3 ballot.\nColumnist Dick Spotswood of Mill Valley now shares his views on local politics twice weekly in the IJ.

Nearly all are self-nominated.\"\nSo there you have it people of Marin. It is your very own elected officials who are to blame.\nTherefore, if you disapprove, all those in elected office in Marin County should be scrutinized before the next elections.\nIn the same vein, I find it ironic that the same 180 new units are located nearly next door to the Marin Municipal Water District which must supply them with the water that we don't have. \nRoger Farrow, Ross\nPlay us a tune, Nero\nThe Jan. 8 IJ gave more column inches and a photo to the September story of the Board of Supervisors including music in its meetings for its calming effect than it did to the erosion of local control happening right before our eyes.\nAt the same meeting, Bruce Corcoran, representing hundreds of Strawberry residents, appeared for the 12th consecutive time. He has a simple request: Set a date for public discussion of Strawberry's Priority Development Area designation.\nAnd still there is no date set, only vagueness about \"some time in February.\"\nWe hear the hollow claim that PDAs and Plan Bay Area don't interfere with local control. Marc Luce, president of the Association of Bay Area Governments, says the community chooses to have a PDA. But that's not the case in Strawberry.\nAnd while the Corte Madera WinCup property isn't in a PDA, a lot of residents protest they, too, were never adequately informed or engaged.\nThe music in the board chambers sounds a lot like fiddling while Rome burns.\nSusan Kirsch, Mill Valley\nOPEN SPACE\nRoom to wander\nThere have been many letters about the use of our open space.\nWhile a trail system is designed to lead users to significant areas such as view points, the trails are not the only use for the open space. Many users want to get a closer look at nature and that requires exploring areas off the trails.\nI doubt the voters wanted the open space to be an inaccessible desolation area. It was designed to eliminate development of residential and commercial uses.\nRational restrictions on developing trails are needed, but to disallow \"wandering off the trail\" by walkers eliminates the ability to explore nature.\nThe key is to restrict activities that lead to developing unplanned trails that lead to degradation, such as erosion.\nNick Clark, San RafaeL\nTRANSPORTATION\nRaise ferry rates\nThe Golden Gate Bridge District is seeking public input on four separate fare hike options, each of which is limited to increases in Fastrak and Pay-By-Plate fares.\nI suggest that another option needs to be considered, namely, an increase in ferry fares at a rate equal to that being proposed for Fastrak.\nIt is not clear why the ferries have been spared a rate increase since the Larkspur ferry appears to be so popular that additional parking at Larkspur Landing is being considered while the Sausalito ferry has become a magnet for bike-riding tourists and is a bargain Bay cruise to boot.\nChanges to bus fares have not been proposed, and, in my opinion, should remain at current levels to encourage their broader use by commuters.\nFinally, why are the proposed increases in Pay-By-Plate so timid? Why not increase this fee by $1 annually so that by 2018 it might be $12 rather than $8?\nNeither tourists nor Bay Area visitors flocking to Vista Point, Muir Woods, Point Reyes or the Wine Country will stop using the bridge as a result and, in addition, perhaps even more North Bay and East Bay residents will join the Fastrak program, thus making it even more successful than it already is.\nPeter Jensen, Sausalito\nTRAFFIC SAFETY\nMore enforcement needed\nI read with anticipation the Jan. 14 Marin Voice, \"Making our streets safer\" by San Rafael Police Chief Diana Bishop.\nIn it she mentions that after having no traffic officers for a time, San Rafael now has deployed two motorcycle traffic officers. What she did not mention was that these officers are enjoined by the Public Works Department from using radar guns in all but three areas of San Rafael, to gauge vehicle speed to issue citations.\nThe other alternative to measure speed is to pace a speeding vehicle, which the police department will not do.\n(I learned these facts in a meeting of the San Rafael City Council.)\nWith only two officers assigned to traffic duty and no way to monitor speeding, it's unlikely anyone can be cited for speeding in San Rafael.\nChief Bishop laments her frequent journey as a pedestrian using the crosswalk at Fifth and D Street. With cellphone use, texting or drivers just lost in their own world, she doesn't take it for granted that the sight of a uniformed officer will have an effect on the actions of passing drivers.\nCrossing at Fifth and D is a relatively benign event.\nFor a sobering experience, I would ask her to try the crosswalk at Third Street and Embarcadero Way, next to San Rafael High School, where speeding is a major pastime.\nI could find no concrete steps or strategies offered by Chief Bishop for making our streets safer.\nShe does finish with a New Year's plea, that \"We must all do our part and recognize that we are all responsible for our actions and for the safety of our fellow citizens.\"\nWith all due respect to Chief Bishop, wishful thinking will not make our streets safer.\nJ. S. Danielson, San Rafael\nWATER\nBuild desalination plant\nThe impresario of a famous speakeasy, Texas Guinan, always greeted her guest with the salutation: \"Hello Suckers.\"\nIt seems fitting these days when the governor is calling a \"drought for California.\"\nThe people of Marin had the great opportunity to get desalinated water from the bay, when tests proved it workable. But no, a small minority of greenies objected. They claimed we have enough water and a contract for Russian River water.\nTrue, except that when they have insufficient water, Sonoma County does not have to make any additional deliveries to Marin. In a dry time, Sonoma does not have sufficient supply to sell.\nWhen most needed, it would not be available.\nIf construction of the desalination plant had been approved by the Marin Municipal Water District, Marin would be worry-free about a shortage of water and even have the ability to sell any excess to other locations.\nNow, during a drought, is the time to build desalination operations. After the rains will come another dry spell, and with ever more inhabitants and high-density housing, more and more water will be needed.\nThink about this when you have to save the bath water, and use it by the bucket to flush the toilet.\nThis time don't fall for false stories   promote desalinization.\nMarin should not be suckered again into not getting a full desalination plant up and operating.\nThere is really no need to suffer.\nLeonard Malherbe, Mill Valley", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 22"}, {"relevance": [102.5], "text": "Marin residents raised concerns about a proposed toll increase for the Golden Gate Bridge that could raise the fee as high as $8 for some users.\nThe bridge district held a public session Tuesday evening at Whistlestop Wheels in downtown San Rafael to hear from the public on a likely toll increase that could go into place by April 7.\n\"Things are scary right now economically for people and you have to look at every single thing,\" said Patrick Knight of San Anselmo, who was pleased to hear bike and pedestrian tolls are not being looked at presently. \"If you live in Marin and work in San Francisco you end up paying for gas and parking, so adding a buck or two is a big deal for people. It adds up. It's on a lot of people's minds.\" \nFour options to raise tolls were presented to the public at the meeting.\nOne scenario calls for a 50-cent increase for April, followed by a series of toll increases that would have Fastrak users paying $6.50 in 2018 and pay-by-plate users paying an $8 toll. That plan would raise $83 million over five years.\nAnother calls for a $1 increase in April, then toll increases in the following five years. That would raise $138 million over five years. That would put the Fastrak toll at $7 and the pay-by-plate toll at $8 in 2018.\nOther options raise $117 million and $123 million over the five years.\n\"It is hard for senior citizens,\" said Maria Barrows of San Anselmo. \"We didn't get much of an increase in our Social Security. So any increase would be a hardship for us crossing the bridge.\"\nWith all-electronic tolls now on the bridge   all toll takers were eliminated in March 2012   the cost to cross could be raised by less than whole dollars if desired without fear of a traffic backup because no change has to be made.\nTolls were last raised by $1 in 2008. Fastrak users now pay $5 to cross the span, while pay-by-plate drivers pay $6.\nThe district has a projected five-year, $142 million deficit, up from a $66 million deficit in 2012. It would take a toll increase to reduce the projected deficit to a manageable level, according to the district.\nBridge officials find themselves grappling with a growing deficit and dwindling reserves and tolls appear to be the only option to get back into the financial black.\nPersonnel costs, the seismic retrofit of the span, a $75 million bill to help pay for the ongoing Doyle Drive upgrade, south tower painting and the partial loss of revenue from a downsized local bus contract with Marin County, have fueled the district's deficit, bridge officials said.\n\"In the long run they should give the bridge to the state,\" said Dwight Steeves of San Rafael, who was critical of bridge officials giving $75 million to the Doyle Drive rebuild project and said leaders need to do a better job of seeking federal dollars to pay for capital costs.\nThe bridge is run by a special district, while the rest of the Bay Area bridges are operated by Caltrans. Steeves said Marin residents would pay less if the Golden Gate was run by the state.\n\"The toll would go down to what the state bridges charge,\" he said.\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Traffic flows smoothly out of the toll plaza of the Golden Gate Bridge on Wednesday, Mar. 27, 2013, in San Francisco, Calif.

The longtime Santa Venetia resident was 91 years old. \nMr. Pieper was a member of the COM athletic department staff for 35 years, coaching the football team to the conference championship in 1956 and presiding over the construction of the athletic portion of campus during his long tenure as AD.\n\"What he valued most was the relationships with the student-athletes,\" said Rod Pieper, Harry's son. \"We would run into students wherever we went in Marin and I'll always remember the respect. That connection was the passion in his life.\"\nMr. Pieper, who was elected to the COM Athletic Hall of Fame in 2012, was a second-team All-America selection as a center and linebacker on the Cal football team. During the 1947 Big Game, Cal beat Stanford on a last-second touchdown pass from Jackie Jensen to Paul Keckley. Mr. Pieper was part of the play.\n\"Dad was playing center. He saw the pass develop, ran downfield and made two blocks that helped spring Keckley,\" said Rod Pieper, noting that his father was one of Pappy's Boys who played in the Rose Bowl for legendary Cal coach Pappy Waldorf.\nCollege of Marin no longer has a football team, but the field where the team once played is named in his honor.\nHe is survived by Lenore, his wife of 65 years, his sons Rod and Stephen, his daugher-in-law and grandchildren.\nServices are Friday at Keaton's Mortuary, 1022 E Street in San Rafael.

But for heavier users the board wants the public to take heed and reduce use.\n\"We need to get the conservation ethic set up,\" Russell said.\nThe lack of rain has shown up in the county's water consumption. Last year at this time 16.7 million gallons were used a day, or 90.4 gallons per person. This year that has jumped to 19.6 million galls a day, or 105.9 gallons per person.\nFor the third year in a row, the weather has been dry. As a result, reservoirs are much lower than normal for this winter season and are unlikely to fill with the spring runoff, according to the district.\nThis week the district's reservoirs contained 43,340 acre-feet and the reservoirs are at 54 percent of capacity. Typically at this time of year there are 63,058 acre feet and the reservoirs are at 79 percent of capacity. An acre foot can supply about three single-family homes with water for a year. There are 325,851 gallons in an acre foot.\nIf the district's watersheds do not receive a substantial amount of rain over the next few months, the amount of water stored in the reservoirs will be looked at April 1.\nAt that point if there are less than 40,000 acre feet, a 25 percent mandatory program would be implemented. The current dry year water use reduction program was adopted by the district in February 1999 in response to the extended drought of 1987 through 1992.\nMarin just experienced its driest year on record. In 2013, 10.68 inches of rain were recorded at Lake Lagunitas, where the water district   which has data dating to 1879   keeps its official weather gauge.\nThe previous record low was set in 1929 when 19.06 inches of rain fell.

The project includes outdoor turf fields, on a 16.6-acre site near Gallinas Creek, the airport and McInnis Park. \nThe Gallinas Creek Defense Council, a group of residents and organizations in the area, sued the city, City Council and the project applicant, San Rafael Airport LLC, in January 2013, arguing the sports project had an incomplete environmental impact report. A settlement agreement was reached, which includes decreasing outdoor nighttime activities, eliminating skylights, building a stronger roof and adding more fencing.\nBut now the Captain's Cove Property Owners Association, which has 160 members, has sent a lawyer's letter to the city stating a new environmental impact report needs to be drafted reflecting the current drought situation. Plus what really has neighbors heated is the airport owner's request to increase the hours of operation for indoor activities   a proposal the defense council will not oppose under the settlement agreement.\nAs part of the settlement, outdoor soccer field hours will open at 9 a.m. and close at 9 p.m., instead of allowing operations to last until 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. A loss of hours has prompted the airport to ask its indoor operations last until 11 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays and midnight on Fridays and Saturdays, instead of 10:30 p.m. and 11 p.m., respectively.\nComplex operator Andrew Rowley, president of Santa Rosa-based Sports City, said the extra hours are crucial for the business. He said during the eight years he's sat through public comment, the biggest concern has been outdoor field hours, not indoor field hours.\n\"Thirty minutes is critical because kids can only play until a certain time. Closing at 10:30 p.m., that only gives the adults a few hours to play,\" Rowley said. \"We charge lower fees for the youth and the only way to do that is charge the adults more.\"\nThe City Council originally approved the longer indoor hours when it OK'd the project in December 2012 by a 3-1 vote   with Councilman Damon Connolly dissenting   but hinged the implementation on a one-year review. If Contempo Marin and Captain's Cove residents weren't bothered by traffic noise after one year of operations, the complex could increase it's nighttime hours.\nGreenbrae lawyer Len Rifkind, who is representing the Captain's Cove Property Owners Association, said the increased hours of operation would negatively impact the surrounding neighborhood by further increasing noise and traffic on a barely two lane road.\n\"It may seem like it's not that much, but this is a suburban neighborhood and it's now being forced, into our view, almost an urban setting,\" Rifkind said. \"We should see the operator be a good neighbor first.\"\nCaptain's Cove resident Paul Vasquez, one of about 45 people in the audience, agreed.\n\"It's my backyard we're talking about,\" Vasquez said. \"I think it's absolutely outrageous in the extreme to propose midnight closure on Sundays.\"\nFor Captain's Cove Property Owners Association board member Leili First, increases in noise and artificial light, plus traffic congestion, are major concerns.\n\"It will cause noise and light immediately adjacent to our property every single night of the year,\" First said. \"That little access road is practically unnavigable.\"\nFrances Nunez, of Santa Venetia, is concerned about the impacts on her neighborhood, too. She said the council shouldn't go back on its promise to review the extended hours in one year.\n\"There was a promise made by this city council to the people,\" Nunez said.\nCouncil members voted unanimously to continue the item until the next meeting, placing it on the council's consent agenda. The council wants planning staff to craft a resolution that states the city won't increase the soccer complex's hours immediately, but review the issue after a year. In addition, a noise study will be held during the complex's first year of operation to monitor noise levels.\nCity Councilman Andrew McCullough said he feels for the neighbors, but is frustrated that none of them praised the complex owner's willingness to add additional safety measures and reduce its outdoor hours.\n\"I'm torn here, but compelled by the arguments made by the neighbors,\" McCullough said. \"I do feel somewhat duty-bound to abide by the commitment we made.\"\nCity Councilwoman Kate Colin agreed.\n\"We haven't talked about the safety measures proposed and I'm delighted to see those,\" Colin said.\nCity Councilwoman Maribeth Bushey Lang said the complex owner's willingness to reduce outdoor hours and their request to increase indoor hours seems reasonable.\n\"I see it basically as numerically a wash,\" Bushey Lang said.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

The win -- coupled with Drake's loss to Novato -- means Redwood is in a three-way tie for first with Branson and the Pirates. \nBut the Giants needed to overcome the feisty Trojans (8-11, 2-5) who shot a sizzling 42.9 percent from beyond the arc.\n\"We were expecting a battle,\" said Breck, who was 10 for 13 from the stripe and added 11 boards to help his squad outrebound Terra Linda, 40-32. \"We were ready for a battle and we got one.\"\nRedwood coach Steve Compagno, right after raving about Breck's \"absolute monster\" of a performance, echoed the same sentiment.\n\"There are no easy nights in this league,\" he said. \"It's a challenge every time.\"\nThe Trojans, still deeply in the hunt for the league's final playoff spots, certainly made the Giants sweat. The visitors led by as many as seven in a game that saw five ties and 12 lead changes.\nWith four players in double figures, led by Beau Keeve's 25 and Dederian's 14, Terra Linda connected 12 times from beyond the arc.\nNone were bigger than the shot by Dederian to force an extra period.\nAfter five lead changes over the final three minutes of the fourth quarter alone, the Trojans trailed 67-64 when they inbounded from midcourt with 2.8 seconds left. But Dederian ensured four more minutes of play with his third 3-pointer of the period and fourth of the game   an arcing, fall-away jumper from the right wing.\n\"Kirby shot the hell out of the ball today,\" Trojans coach Steve Farbstein said. \"He hit a tough, tough shot there and he's been really coming on. This was a phenomenal, phenomenal game.\"\nBut one in which the Giants reasserted control, outscoring Terra Linda 17-10 during OT. Farbstein was wary over Redwood's size on the boards and after going toe-to-toe throughout regulation, Terra Linda was unable to keep pace on the glass. That rebounding edge also helped the Giants finish 25 for 32 from the line on the night, compared to just 11 for 15 for TL.\nRedwood got 17 points from Peter Kennedy (including 10-for-14 shooting at the foul line), 12 from Nick Jones and 11 by Jack Bronson.\nJosh Pinto had 13 points and seven boards for the Trojans, while Zach Able scored 12.\nRedwood travels to Marin Catholic on Friday, while Terra Linda hosts Drake.\n\"The rest of the way for us, it's just a playoff atmosphere,\" Farbstein said. \"We have to think and play that way if we want to be a playoff team.\"\nContact Ed Yevelev via email at eyevelev@marinij.com\nREDWOOD 84, TERRA LINDA 77\nMCAL\nTerra Linda 18 16 15 18 10   77\nRedwood 16 15 21 15 17   84\nTERRA LINDA Keeve 8 5-6 25, Gable 3 2-2 9, Pinto 6 0-0 13, DiMatteo 1 1-2 4, Dederian 4 2-2 14, Able 5 1-3 12.

Henley Photography", "author": "Compiled by Nick Bensen", "title": "Marin food calendar for the week of Jan. 22, 2014"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "In order for a restaurant to be thought of as a diner, the food served must hew to a few traditions. One, there must be many dishes of classic American food such as pancakes and meatloaf. Two, those dishes need some local flair. Three, the comfort foods of the owner's home country should be a main point of attraction. Sure, the Lighthouse Caf\u00c8 in Corte Madera does not call itself a diner, but in shape and substance, the Lighthouse hits all three traditions squarely on the head.\nBreakfast, as it should be at a diner, is served until well into the afternoon. Eggs, such as the Lighthouse omelet with ham, mushrooms and onion ($12.50), come with hash browns and toast. A Mickey Mouse pancake ($4.50) was three fist-sized rounds, the side of fruit arranged in bits and berries, face-like, on one round. Coffee ($2.50) is not designer and servers walk around with glass carafes, topping up your cup. \nSo far, you could be eating at any diner in America. Then the Danish meatballs ($12.50) arrived. Seasoned with onion, pepper and a splash of milk, the 100 percent pork meatballs were the best meatballs I have eaten in years. (Sorry, mom.) Tender, juicy, porky with a hint of piquancy, these frikadeller are fried in butter and canola oil. Topped with a dab of the house-made r\u00c8moulade, the meatballs became simply irresistible.\nLighthouse's partners, Annette and Gerner Andresen, known for their work at Sausalito's Lighthouse Caf\u00c8 and for the San Rafael Lighthouse that closed five months ago, hail from Denmark. At Corte Madera, a new menu page, the Danish Connection, was added when they took over the former Corte Madera Caf\u00c8. Herring, a traditional dish of the North Sea countries, is available curried ($10.95) and pickled ($10.50). The pungent sweetness of the cured fish wallops your palate before you realize the trick the vinegar has played, rendering the pickled herring mild and   wait for it   soft. Like the meatballs, Danish hash or Bik ($12.95) was a dish Annette Andresen's mother used to make.\n\"It has a little bit of everything,\" says Andresen.\nPeppery, rough-cut roast beef was topped with caramelized onions and a sunny side-up egg. Mix it up with the hash browns, pickled cucumbers and beets on this huge plate and you will be happily sated for the day.\nMore changes are afoot. Lighthouse's other partners, Julie Henderson and Jeremy John, also partners at Wellingtons in Sausalito, are putting together new dinner service to be called Night Lights, expected in February. Though the new wine and dinner menus are still a work in progress, flatbreads, charcuterie, cheeses and small plates designed for sharing will balance a world of flavors in dishes like the chicken Thai wok ($15) and grilled Atlantic salmon with pineapple mango salsa ($17).\nJohn hails from the British Isles where the comfort foods are bangers and mash (aka veal sausage and mashed potatoes, $14) and shepherd's pie ($14). And the Danish-Italian-American mash-up of spaghetti Bolognese will feature Andresen's oval-shaped gems. Expect about 20 wines by the glass ($6 to $15) and 15 beers ($4 to $6).\nTo match the new food is new d\u00c8cor. British and Danish vintage posters hang alongside paintings by Sausalito artist John Wilmer. Soft black placemats add a dash of refinement to the dineresque black-and-white checkerboard floor and cushy stools at the L-shaped counter. Service is diner-friendly. No one here responds to the names Maude or Alice, but short orders do not call for long chats.\nThe Lighthouse partners are working to revive the San Rafael Lighthouse in a new location in San Anselmo. The anticipated opening date of February has been pushed back as the partners work to bring the building up to code. In the meanwhile, American-European comfort foods with a dash of home cooking and a California sensibility are available in central and southern Marin.\nChristina Mueller writes about food   restaurants, chefs, products and trends   for local and national publications as well as other industry clients.

If Drakes Bay is denied, it can make the same request of the Supreme Court.\nIn its filing, Lunny's team outlines some of the legal issues it is likely to take to the Supreme Court. It notes the 9th Circuit was split on whether federal courts have \"jurisdiction to review discretionary agency actions when the agency has not issued regulations governing the issuance of a permit.\"\nThe Drakes Bay closure order came on Nov. 29, 2012, when then Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced he would allow a 40-year lease   originally negotiated with the Johnson Oyster Co. in 1972 and taken on by Drakes Bay   to expire.\nThe filing also noted the 9th Circuit is split over whether an \"environmental conservation effort\" is exempt from the National Environmental Policy Act, even if it harms the environment.\nFinally, it's noted the federal government failed to follow National Environmental Policy Act requirements as it prepared an environmental impact statement on the oyster operation because it didn't provide the public with a \"meaningful opportunity to comment\" on it.\n\"These issues   the scope of jurisdiction over discretionary agency actions, whether NEPA applies to 'environmental conservation efforts' or those actions that have only beneficial effects, and whether an agency commits prejudicial error when it does not comply with public-disclosure requirements   are important issues that merit Supreme Court review,\" according to the filing.\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Drakes Bay Oyster company owner Kevin Lunny remains stoic in spite of the bad news he received today at Drakes Bay Oyster company in Point Reyes National Seashore, Calif.

He was 90.\nBorn in 1923 in London, England, he was a lieutenant in Britain's Middlesex Regiment and was a veteran of the Anzio beachhead landing in Italy. After the war, he trained at the Old Vic Theatre School and toured post-World War II Europe with the Old Vic Co. before coming to the U.S. in 1950 on a Fulbright Scholarship to attend Stanford University as a guest artist.\nWhile at Stanford, he acted for a season with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland. After a brief return to England, he and then-wife Ann Brebner started the Bay Area's first professional casting agency in 1960 as well as the Marin Shakespeare Festival. The state's first outdoor Shakespeare troupe, it performed at the Marin Art and Garden Center for six seasons before moving into Forest Meadows amphitheater on the campus of Dominican University in San Rafael, its home until it closed in 1973. (It was re-established in 1989 as Marin Shakespeare Co.).\n\"England was very gloomy at that time, both economically and weather wise, and he fell in love with California and with doing Shakespeare outdoors, which no one even in England was doing,\" said his second wife, Barbara Young.\nIn the 1970s, Mr. Brebner formed a children's theatre company that developed social and historical shows, performing in 280 schools in California and Alaska for eight years. He was the first artist in the schools in Marin County, a position sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts and the California Arts Council. He held a similar post in Alaska.\n\"He knew how to relate to kids, treating them like adults,\" his wife said. \"He never talked down to them.

We wish him well and he's going to help us through the process of replacing him, which is great. His leadership will be missed,\" said Jim Schalich, president of the board of directors. \nSchalich will lead an executive committee appointed by the board to find a replacement for Knoles' position, which draws approximately $100,000 annually, Schalich said.\nWhen Knoles joined the association in 1969, it was only 11 years old, having begun when a handful of members set up shop on a San Rafael side street in 1958. The association is now on Gallinas Avenue across from the Northgate mall.\nKnoles served as president from 2003 to 2004 and as director from 1996 to 2005, additionally serving on several committees and trusts.\nOne of his favorite memories is sponsoring construction technology classes for high school students and adults at Redwood High School in partnership with the Marin County Office of Education and the Regional Occupational Program. \"Our member Tom Eller, a contractor, teaches the class,\" Knoles said in an email.\n\"I was later asked to co-chair the School to Career Partnership with Marin County school superintendent Mary Jane Burke,\" Knoles said. The partnership gives on-the-job experience to students from diverse economic backgrounds.\nAt the time, Burke told the Independent Journal, \"To date, there have been thousands of students from our community whose lives have changed because of the men and women from the builders association. They are amazing.\"\n\"During my tenure we celebrated the association's 50th anniversary in 2008, a gala event held at the Marin Center,\" Knoles said.\nStarting in 2010, the group began producing the annual expo. This year, the association will not sponsor the expo, Schalich said, but will instead assist another organization in putting it on.\nOver the years, the association has served the construction industry by providing health insurance and workers compensation to its members and scholarships for their children. It is active in county affairs, supporting nonprofit organizations, offering political advocacy and educating its members.\nThe group had 1,000 members in 2008, but membership has fallen to 600, Schalich said.\n\"The whole economy dropped our numbers, definitely,\" said Schalich, referring to the recession of 2008 that devastated Marin's real estate industry.\n\"The economy was hit hard in 2008 and construction was on the front lines.

Others object to it, saying the all-girls learning environment is a crucial resource that is being taken away from the community.\nThat was expressed on the San Anselmo campus Tuesday, when about a third of the high school's 170 students came to school dressed in black, to express mourning for the change. \nBecause Monday was a holiday, Tuesday was the first opportunity for the school administrators and staff to speak with the students about the new policy. The school day began with a special assembly to explain the decision, after which students broke into smaller groups, with their school advisers, to discuss the matter.\nThe decision, made Friday through a unanimous vote by the school's 20-member board of directors, was driven by the high school's dropping enrollment, which has gradually declined from 300 in the last 50 years. While the motive is largely financial, the move is in response to what administrators say is a declining demand for single-gender schools.\nThough the market is declining, some say the demand still exists   and the girls-only school is still needed.\n\"It's such a vulnerable and fragile place in a woman's life,\" said senior Rachel Zilberg. \"There are always going to be people who need this kind of environment.\"\nAlong with current students and parents, alumnae are also speaking against the move to co-ed. A Facebook page titled \"Keep San Domenico Upper School All Girls!\" has 274 members   mostly alumnae.\nThe oldest Catholic school in California, San Domenico first opened in 1850 in Monterey. After a period in Benicia, the school moved to San Rafael in 1889, then to its current Sleepy Hollow location   on 515 acres   in 1965. While the lower grades, from pre-kindergarten to eighth grade, are all co-ed, the high school has remained girls-only.\nNone of the girls attending San Domenico now is likely to share classrooms with boys. The first boys will be admitted for the fall of 2015, when current freshmen will be juniors. That first year, the school plans to let in only freshmen boys   about 30   and a handful of sophomore transfers, said Head of School Cecily Stock.\nBut those objecting to the change say it's not about how the decision will affect their time at San Domenico.\n\"It's about the future generations that aren't going to have this experience,\" said sophomore Ember Brightwood, wearing a T-shirt that read, \"well-behaved girls rarely make history.\"\nThose in favor of a single-gender setting, particularly for girls, say the high school years are a crucial time for a girl to develop her voice and sense of empowerment. An all-girls school allows her the freedom to do so, they say, without worrying about judgments from the other sex.\nThe right high school environment could be the difference in whether some girls grow up to be future leaders and self-respecting women, some say.\n\"When the male culture becomes the school culture, the girls who don't fit that take it out on themselves,\" said Nancy Weins, whose daughter is a junior at the school. \"San Domenico has been an oasis away from that kind of pressure.\"\nWeins said she was initially hesitant to send her daughter to an all-girls school, concerned it was too much of an isolated environment. But after seeing how her daughter has matured while at San Domenico, she said she has become a believer in the all-girls environment.\nThe arguments are made with references to studies that show boys and girls mature at different rates, that girls in single-gender schools score better on tests, are less likely to cut class, and generally demonstrate stronger mental health.\nBut many people in the San Domenico community say the change won't diminish the experience for girls. They say that regardless of whether it is co-ed, the college prepatory school will continue providing a safe environment and a strong education for everyone who attends.\n\"That's not going to change because of boys\" in the classroom, said sophomore Joan Spalding. \"If anything, it's going to grow. The point is gender equality, not one gender above another.\"\nSome of those in favor of the switch, or indifferent to it, say they weren't necessarily drawn to the school because of the single-gender setup. Some went for the sports or music programs, while others say they just liked the overall learning environment.\nEvelyn Wallace, a sophomore, has attended San Domenico since pre-kindergarten. Having spent most of her life attending San Domenico's co-ed lower school, she said that adding boys to the high school mix won't interfere with girls finding their voices.\n\"In middle school I was never ashamed to speak my mind or share my opinion,\" she said.\nWallace's mother, Mary Wallace, said that if the integration of boys in the high school reflects the co-ed environment in the middle school, the new San Domenico will be just as strong as the old.\n\"The boys in the middle school are respectful to girls,\" Mary Wallace said. \"These are boys who value the feminine.\"\nThe challenge, ultimately, will be on the faculty and staff to keep the school running with the same mission it has now: preparing its students for college and to grow up to be well-rounded people.\n\"In the end, it gets back to a matter of trust in us that we are going to continue to engage and educate in ways that we have in all these years,\" said John Bowermaster, who teaches English and philosophy at San Domenico. \"We'll just do it in a somewhat different environment.\"\nContact Laith Agha via email atlagha@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: San Domenico students, (l to r) Izzy Phraner, Ember Brightwood and Christa Collman embraces one another after leaving a school assembly that discussed the high school going co-educational on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2014 in San Anselmo.

Jerry Brown to ban fracking until those concerns are addressed.\nThat seems to be a common sense approach in addressing growing public concern about fracking and growing interest in the use of fracking to pull oil out of California's shale fields, which nearly run the length of the state.\nIn particular, the letter calls for in-depth study of potential impacts on groundwater supply, climate change, disposal of wastewater caused by the technique and potential seismic activity.\nFracking already is taking place in California, mostly in Kern County. It is a form of hydraulic fracturing of rock formations using pressurized chemicals and water to reach trapped pockets of oil and natural gas.\nA recent University of Southern California study reported that California has the largest deep-shale reserves in the world   a 1,750-square-mile swath of the state, mostly in the San Joaquin Basin. Its potential, the report said, could boost the state's economy by 14 percent and create 2.8 million jobs by 2020.\nIt is a potential that likely is going to increase pressure to expand fracking in California.\nLevine and some other lawmakers want the state to approach this potential with proper caution, especially after environmental hazards tied to fracking in other states.\n\"Until we fully understand the negative effects of fracking, a moratorium is essential to protect our environment and public safety,\" Marin's assemblyman said in a recent press conference. \"The risks are simply too great to allow fracking to continue.\"\nLast year, Levine joined other legislators in support of a bill that established a permitting system for fracking. That he voted for that bill, which was signed by the governor, and a few months later wants Brown to declare a moratorium on fracking looks a little clumsy. But not every political move is a political version of Baryshnikov.\nLevine says he voted for the bill because it offered some regulations and precautions that we sorely needed. More are needed, but they lacked the political support needed for passage.\nA moratorium would halt new permits until those issues are studied and addressed.\nLevine authored legislation last year aimed at toughening state regulation of the industry, including requiring \"safe methods and practices.\" Oil and business powers opposed the bill. It died on the Assembly floor, falling short of a majority vote because 20 lawmakers abstained.\nLevine's reasonable concern is that the state lacks the safeguards that meet those goals, and others.\nHe should re-introduce the bill, putting the letter into legislation.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Marc Levine, pictured in 2012.

She thought about all the things that might have gone right that day   the elderly woman didn't slip in her tub, the teenagers didn't pass out on the beach even though they had been drinking booze and playing volleyball all day, the speeding MG didn't plow into the cows that had busted free from Giacomini's ranch and were contentedly munching grass dangerously close to the road   and turned it into a short story. \n\"I took the other sheriff's calls in the paper and had them not happen,\" says Solomon, a self-employed electrical engineer who lives in San Anselmo and Point Reyes Station. \"I just played around.\"\nWhen she read it before an open mike a few weeks later, something unexpected happened; the crowd went wild.\n\"Before I read it, I was thinking it was just terrible,\" she says, \"but they laughed, and so that encouraged me to try it again.\"\nAnd she did, 80 times. Those 80 short stories appear in \"Point Reyes Sheriff's Calls\" (292 pages, HD Media Press, $16.95), her first book. Each story begins with a real sheriff's call but, thanks to Solomon's vivid imagination, takes off in a funny or sad direction as a handful of her engaging characters grapple with the everyday drama of life.\nThere's Fred, who, in his 70s, tends to get easily confused, and his opinionated, gun-happy wife, Mildred. There's Thomas, the girl-obsessed teen who's always getting in trouble. There's Doris, a single mom who, as the town's hairdresser, knows everyone's secrets. And there's Officer Linda Kettleman, the new sheriff who happens to be a knockout.\nSolomon, 64, always wanted to be an author. She graduated college with a degree in English and studied for many years with journalist Melba Beals and author Jim Frey, who helped shape her two memoirs and 1\u03a9 novels. But she couldn't attract an agent or a publisher.\nIt was an entirely different story with her short stories, however. Solomon caught publisher Patricia Volonakis Davis' eye with just one story, \"Following Orders,\" in which Fred, at a loss to remember what Mildred had sent him to the store for and daydreaming that he's courting his young wife in a field, stops in the middle of the street and nearly gets run over. The sheriff's call: At 10:42 a.m. deputies called for backup for a \"pedestrian who was not following orders.\"\n\"We liked the author as much as we liked her writing,\" says Davis, who lives part time in San Anselmo. \"She vividly portrays life in Point Reyes for someone who hasn't been there in a way no travel brochure ever can.\"\nAfter hoping to be published for decades, it was, Solomon says, \"a lark.\"\nWhile her characters aren't modeled after anyone she knows, she's inspired by the quirky people who call West Marin home. She's particularly fond of Mildred.\n\"The characters came to me in bits and pieces, but Mildred came to me full-blown,\" she says. \"She knows what she wants, and she'll do just about anything to get it. And she's wacky. I also really like the relationship she has with her granddaughter, Alice. I always wanted to have a grandmother and so when I wrote those stories, I'd think, gee, I wish I had this kind of a relationship.\"\nShe takes a certain pleasure in getting Thomas into hot water.\n\"In one story, this girl is breathing in his ear and he drives his father's BMW off the road. Poor Thomas   he's always in trouble. I torture Thomas. I torture them all in different ways,\" she says.\nThere's an element of sadness to Solomon's writing, fueled by a challenging childhood   her mother committed suicide when she was 14, one of her two brothers died five years after that, and her father was indifferent and unloving.\nShe married young and moved from Cambridge, Mass., to San Anselmo in 1970.\n\"I wanted to get as far away from my father as I could,\" she says.\nThe marriage didn't last, and Solomon went back to college to study engineering while working full time as a single mom of two. She graduated San Francisco State University summa cum laude, and started her own business in 2000. She married again in 2002, which, she says with a laugh, has come in handy.\n\"Mildred and Fred have been married a long time, and they're used to each other and they talk by each other and they don't necessarily listen that well to each other. It's very useful picking that up from home,\" she says with a sly smile.\nVicki Larson can be reached at vlarson@marinij.com; follow her on Twitter at @OMGchronicles, fan her on Facebook at Vicki-Larson-OMG-Chronicles\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: Susanna Solomon's \"Point Reyes Sheriff's Calls\" book launch\nWhen: 7 p.m. Feb. 8\nWhere: Book Passage, 51 Tamal Vista Blvd., Corte Madera\nAdmission: Free\nInformation: 927-0960;www.bookpassage.com ;susannasolomon.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Some of the short stories in Susanna Solomon's new book, Point Reyes Sheriff Calls, take place inside Cheda's Garage in Pt.

This year the path to the top seems relatively wide open and many teams are headed in the right direction.\nA concern echoed by most coaches in the league is the small team sizes. The league title may come down to which teams can fill the most weight classes.\nNovato looks primed to make a run back to the top behind Karl Beckmann (145). Redwood looks to be a strong competitor with the likes of Stanford recruit Nathan Morris (184). Drake, San Rafael, Tam, San Marin, Justin-Siena and Marin Catholic all have strong individual wrestlers and have the potential to grow as mainly young teams and surprise the top of the heap. Of course Terra Linda, with Michael Walther and Kevin Wong, will have something to say about all of that.\nDRAKE \nCoach: Johann Gerlach (sixth season)\nKeys to success: Drake will be lead by returning MCAL runner-up at 195s Izaak Heath. Heath anchors a Drake team which has grown under Gerlach who coached junior varsity football at the school and was able to recruit wrestlers through that connection. Sophomore Joe See has been stepping up into a leadership role as well and Gerlach looks for him to pick up some wins in league this year.\nThe last word: \"This is our largest group in my six years here,\" Gerlach said. \"Our forecast into the future is pretty encouraging. We just have to live by our motto: determination, dedication, discipline.\"\nJUSTIN-SIENA\nCoach: Roger Bubel (ninth season)\nKeys to success: It's a young Braves team taking to the mat this year but they have one major highlight in the form of Jacob Gardiner. \"He's wrestling at 115 right now but he'll end up at 108,\" Bubel said. \"He could be the first wrestler in Justin-Siena history to medal at state.\" Gardiner will be flanked by Jack England (134) who Bubel noted as having a good shot at being a league champion this year. Outside of those two, Justin-Siena has a young team that is new to the sport.\nThe last word: \"I have a bunch of novices this year,\" Bubel said. \"They're doing alright, they work hard. It's just a learning curve.\"\nMARIN CATHOLIC\nCoach: Chris Feder (seventh season)\nKeys to success: Byron Barrientos is the senior leader of the Wildcats and Feder credits him with leading a small team of only nine wrestlers. \"(Byron) works extremely hard,\" Feder said. \"He's a good leader and has been a pleasure to work with.\" Nicholas Gernhard is only in his second year for the Wildcats but is showing real promise. Gernhard started for the football team at fullback and linebacker and is, \"one of the hardest working kids (Feder has) ever had.\" Feder plans on being able to fill eight weight classes and be competitive in league play.\nThe last word: \"I have very good, hard-working kids,\" Feder said. \"When you're working with freshmen and sophomores it's about the maturation process and learning the sport of wrestling.\"\nNOVATO\nCoach: Eric Brielmaier (sixth season)\nKeys to success: Karl Beckmann (145) is ready to make another run through MCALs and beyond for the Hornets. Beckmann won the MCAL title at 140 last year but has his sights set beyond that now. \"Winning an NCS championship is what I'm looking for this year,\" he said. If the Hornets are to reclaim the MCAL title from Terra Linda it will take contributions from the whole team. Seniors Patrick Sturm, JJ Adkisson, and Christian Romero will help lead the way along with sophomore Paul Adkisson.\nThe last word: \"We have some unfinished business\" Brielmaier said referring to taking the league title back. \"The team that fills the line-up will be the top contender. We have a lot of kids with experience. The last two years we only graduated two seniors so we're bringing a lot of talent back.\"\nREDWOOD\nCoach: Alan Morris (eighth season)\nKeys to success: Nathan Morris has his sights set on MCALs, NCS, and state championships before his career at Redwood ends and his career at Stanford University begins. \"I just want to keep working hard and do the best I can,\" Morris said. \"And I want to be NCS champ and place at state. I'm really hoping to get that MCAL title.\" Morris (184) will lead Redwood through a season in which his team looks to surprise many and become a dark-horse candidate to win the league title. Morris will get help from Kenneth Berreman who appears to be a legitimate contender for the MCAL title at 160s.\nThe last word: \"We had a great group of seniors last year,\" coach Morris said. \"We had five high quality seniors that we're really missing. Nathan and Kenneth have really stepped up and filled that void.\"\nSAN MARIN\nCoach: Dan Donaldson (fifth season)\nKeys to success: On a team comprised mostly of sophomores it's junior Eddie Ferrigno who has taken a leadership role. He does so along with seniors Danny Copperman and Kyle Albertini. \"They work hard in practice,\" Donaldson said of his upperclassmen. \"Some of the younger guys look up to them because they're just learning how to wrestle.\" The Mustangs are looking to compete and develop the younger wrestlers and become a powerhouse in future years.\nThe last word: \"Every year we go in we're looking to do well,\" Donaldson said. \"We'll see how it goes this year. I just look forward to watching these kids wrestle.\"\nSAN RAFAEL\nCoach: Emmanuel Boyd (third season)\nKeys to success: On a team filled with freshmen and sophomores it's senior Sam Zarraonandia who is stepping up and taking over. \"I suspect he'll be challenging for an MCAL medal at 152,\" Boyd said. Then there is senior Tenaya Raives who has been a captain figure on the team the whole time she's been at San Rafael. She used to wrestle on the boys side and Boyd was finally able to convince her to wrestle on the girls side. \"Just wrestle against girls and make a run at state,\" Boyd said to her.\nThe last word: \"My first year we had 12 wrestlers,\" Boyd said. \"Last year we went down and finished the season with seven wrestlers. This year we started the season with 20 wrestlers. We're on the upswing now.\"\nTAM\nCoach: Andre Salinas (22nd season)\nKeys to success: It's a four-headed monster leading the Red-tailed Hawks in the form of Dave Peters, Joseph Fink, Sebastian Tamblyn and Gulam Sheikh. Fink transferred to Tam from Stuart Hall in San Francisco, but based on his wrestling background has taken an immediate leadership role. Sheikh and Tamblyn got the team together in the offseason for workouts and Tam has its sights set on becoming an MCAL competitor.\nThe last word: \"I think our numbers are pretty good and we should cover weight classes pretty good,\" Salinas said. \"We've been working really hard. We'll do a little better than we did last year. It's Dave's third year now and he's starting to hit his stride as a wrestler.\"\nTERRA LINDA\nCoach: Thomas Carry (first season)\nKeys to success: It's a year of change for the reigning MCAL champs. Carry takes the reigns from former coach Danny Dardon and a group of excellent wrestlers graduated. The team now belongs to Michael Wong and Kevin Walther. It'll be a tough road to repeat for the Trojans but they have the wrestlers and the experience to get it done. With the target on their backs, Carry admits to feeling some of the residual pressure of following Dardon. \"(Dardon) established a legacy of winning in this program,\" Carry said. \"Danny garnered a huge amount of respect from the student body.\"\nThe last word: \"We know what we have to do,\" Carry said. \"Michael and Kevin work hard, along with all the kids, and I'm doing all I can to have them ready for league and beyond.\"\nContact Brian Sanchez atbsanchez@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Novato wrestler Karl Beckmann poses for a photograph in Novato, Calif. on Friday, Jan. 17, 2014.

Jerry Brown last week.\nAsking for the voluntary reduction is a part of the district's water shortage contingency plan. The board meets at 7:30 p.m. at 220 Nellen Ave. in Corte Madera. \n\"No one at the district is talking about anything but the drought, it has commanded everyone's attention,\" said Jack Gibson, a member of the water board.\nDistrict officials met last Friday to kick around ideas and the 20 percent voluntary cutback came to the fore.\n\"There is no rain, it's time to conserve, \" Gibson said. \"We know the community spirit is there, they have cut back in the past when asked.\"\nFor the third year in a row, the weather has been dry. As a result, reservoirs are much lower than normal for this winter season and are unlikely to fill with the spring runoff, according to the district.\nAs of last week the district's reservoirs contained 43,600 acre-feet   14,200 million gallons   of water, which is 30 percent or 18,700 acre-feet   6,100 million gallons   lower than normal for this date.\nIf the district's watersheds do not receive a substantial amount of rain over the next few months, the amount of water stored in the reservoirs will be less than 50,000 acre-feet on April 1.\nAt that point if there are less than 40,000 acre feet, a 25 percent mandatory program would be implemented. An acre foot can supply about three single-family homes with water for a year. There are 325,851 gallons in an acre foot.\nThe current dry year water use reduction program was adopted by the district in February 1999 in response to the extended drought of 1987 through 1992.\nMarin just experienced its driest year on record. In 2013, 10.68 inches of rain were recorded at Lake Lagunitas, where the water district   which has data dating to 1879   keeps its official weather gauge.\nThe previous record low was set in 1929 when 19.06 inches of rain fell. The annual average is 52 inches per year.\nThe Marin Municipal Water District serves about 190,000 people between Sausalito and San Rafael and gets 25 percent of its water from Sonoma, the balance coming from local reservoirs on Mount Tamalpais.\nForecasters say there is a glimmer of hope for rain at the end of this month or early February, but nothing is forecast before then.\n\"There will be nothing in the next week,\" said Austin Cross, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. \"There is a hint of some rain later, but it doesn't look impressive.

There is no reasonable argument to continue it.\nAny salmon that have not made it to the bay by now are doomed.\nThese resources are precious now and should be saved for Marin County residents.\nAndrew Bailey, Lagunitas\nFocus on saving water\nRegarding the IJ's Sunday's editorial, \"Action needed now as drought appears lengthy,\" will Marin Municipal Water District set a moratorium on new hook-ups?\nThe proposed soccer complex at the private San Rafael Airport has plans for 700-1,000 daily attendees (including teams from beyond Marin). In the hours from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sundays through Thursdays and 9 a.m. to midnight on Fridays and Saturdays.\nHow many new \"flushes\" per day is that, in addition to the water use for operation and maintenance?\nAnn Thompson, San Rafael\nBikes should cover costs\nReading Dick Spotswood's column on Sunday raises some great questions about funding for bicycle-related projects.\nSince bikes are not licensed vehicles there seems to be no tax-raising paradigm for these projects.\nIt is only because of a special federal grant that Marin can make spectacular investments in bicycle infrastructure.\nThis is not going to create long-term funding to maintain and continue to build the bicycle infrastructure of the future.\nThe time has come to license bikes to raise money.\nAs a car driver, I am forced, by special taxes and tolls, to fund the infrastructure and maintenance required.\nFair is fair.\nOnce bikes are licensed it should be illegal to ride one without proper ID.\nJust look at what San Francisco is going through right now with aggressive bikers and the problems they cause.\nThey are hard to ticket.\nOften the best way to change behavior is punitively. This is not taking place in the bicycle community.\nNo group I can think of is held less accountable for following laws designed for their activity.\nMarin should lead the way in licensing, taxing and enforcing laws on bicycles.\nDaniel Grossman, Mill Valley\nPreserving Novato\nI am a \"country woman,\" (Readers' Forum, Jan. 18) and I have a need   a need for feed.\nMore specifically, my horses do.\nDoes David Adams' version of progress have to completely obliterate the charm that Novato once had?\nI hope not.\nKim Vogee, Novato", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 21"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "THE CONTROVERSY raging in Strawberry over proposed high-density housing development on property owned by the Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary shows no signs of abating.\nIn fact it may just be heating up.\nThe reasons for the citizen uprising are understandable and it was predictable.\nClearly, there was a hardening of positions when irate residents were not brought into the public process early enough. Whether that was by design or default is not known. However, when a small, informed community is confronted with decisions made from on high without sufficient explanation there is bound to be reaction. \nAs an unincorporated area lacking any formal political voice in its affairs, that duty falls upon its county representative who in this case is the newly-installed Board of Supervisors President Kate Sears of Sausalito.\nSears, a Harvard-trained lawyer formerly with the state Attorney General's office where she got high marks for her handling of tough cases, was elected without opposition after appointment by the Gov. Jerry Brown to the spot left vacant by the untimely death of Supervisor Charles McGlashan.\nSears was barely seated when the storm clouds over Strawberry were already gathering.\nIn designating the seminary a Priority Development Area (PDA) in Plan Bay Area's implementation and thus an eligible site for subsidized housing, the degree of unhappiness may not have been anticipated. It should have been.\nSimilar problems facing her colleague, Supervisor Susan Adams, the target of a recall involving development of Marinwood Plaza, served fair warning this issue would not go away quickly.\nA contentious meeting with Strawberry residents in August kindled temperatures even further. Repeated requests for an up-or-down vote by the supervisors to have the Strawberry PDA removed have been rebuffed on grounds that non-compliance with state housing mandates could jeopardize millions of dollars in transportation funding.\nGiven that, Sears contends that resolution of this issue rests appropriately with the Transportation Authority of Marin, which opponents dispute since it has no authority over PDA designations. They say PDAs are a voluntary determination for each community.\nThere is some speculation that the seminary, to assure sale of the highly valuable real estate, may be taking advantage of the county's reinterpretation of its decades-old master plan zoning regulations, which called for 2.47 units per acre of subsidized housing on the property.\nBy invoking so-called Affordable Housing Combined District map overlays, 30 units per acre of high density or \"clustered\" housing as county planners prefer to call it, are permissible.\nThe Strawberry Community Plan, ratified by the county in 1982, advocated the lower densities.\nIn support of its position, opponents cite census-backed statistics which show that only 39 percent of Strawberry's housing stock is owner occupied in contrast with 63 percent for the county.\nThis goes to the nub of citizen grievances. The theory behind the sustainable communities concept, they argue, is for fair and equitable distribution of the housing mix without imposing excessive burdens on any single community.\nMarinwood and Tam Valley were able to opt out and Novato has negotiated a deal with the state for 20-23-units-per-acre densities.\nOpponents see this as a blatant attempt to apply different standards to different communities, and if the goal is to promote high density developments next to city-centered transit corridors to best serve urban populations, there is justification for saying this misses the mark.\nThe seminary has not yet signaled if it will go along with the county's plans. But if this process has been in any way influenced by forces that may not be compatible with Strawberry's legitimate interests in its own destiny, corrective actions are still possible and full transparency is required.\nAs our neighborhoods evolve and grow, change is inevitable, including our housing needs. County officials can recommend changes. Decisions on how best to implement and manage those changes are a right reserved to each community. Strawberry is no exception.\nRichard Rubin of Strawberry writes about political issues and is president of a public affairs management firm.

That gave us a lot of confidence for our league where we feel we will win a lot of games. (Coach) Mike (Fulton) put me at the two-guard instead of point guard this season. I feel more natural at the two. I have been working on my shot, even during volleyball season. I knew I had to step up and I did.\"\n* What's next: Nagler said the Panthers, who won another game in the Martin Luther King Tournament on Monday, are focused on the eight remaining league games. \"If we get the whole team on the score sheet, we can be tough. Everyone's playing hard. We don't want Mike to tell us to play hard, we want to show we can do it without being told.\"\n* Off the court: Nagler has a demanding schedule of classes including three APS classes and one honors class. \"I have to really study hard and buckle down. I have to be good at time management. I did work at a bakery part-time but had to quit because I was so busy with school.\"\n* Trivial matter: Nagler says she's a big fan of comic books. \"I'm obsessed with comic books and especially Thor. I even named my dog after him.\" Nagler also said that at the bakery where she previously worked, she made the morning pastries including croissants, cinnamon rolls and cookies.\n* Coach Mike Fulton: \"She's really stepped up her offensive game, and we need it for us to be successful. She has a legitimate off-the-dribble jump shot and that wasn't in her repertoire as a freshman and sophomore. It has been very consistent this year. Defensively, you can't replace someone like her. She's going to guard the other team's best perimeter player.

He had 17 points and 11 rebounds to help beat Terra Linda on Tuesday before dropping 27 points, snagging 10 boards and swatting four shots in Friday's win over Justin-Siena. \n* What he said: \"After our 0-4 start in MCAL, we were starting to get a little scared. But we decided to stay together; it was just a bad time for us then. Right now we have to have everybody hold together and get back to the goal. For me, I've been kind of slow getting up to speed in scoring and rebounding. But now I'm being more aggressive and my teammates are looking for me more.\"\n* What's next: After their rough start in league play, the Mustangs are trying to dig out of a hole. \"We have a tough game against Branson (Tuesday) that we really need to win. We need to win all our games after that slow start. We have to play like every game is a playoff game.\"\n* Off the court: Reyff says he's a pretty typical teenager during his down time, playing video games, hanging out with friends and eating a lot.\n* Trivial matter: Reyff says he enjoys catching up on TV shows that he has missed. \"I really like 'Breaking Bad.' I'm in the middle of season 4 right now. Other than that, I love to just go out and shoot hoops in my driveway.\"\n* Coach Craig Pttti: \"We've had a rough start with a ton of injuries and (Jason) had his bout with the flu. We needed all 32 minutes from him against Justin-Siena. As he's progressed through the season, with all the different lineup changes, we've had to ask him to do more. I've been so impressed with the new responsibilities that he's taken, and that's what good seniors do. He's been handling the ball more and has been a better passer. We can do a lot more with him.

In any event, don't blame county supervisors.\nThat's the word from Ross Valley Supervisor Katie Rice, who launched a discussion touching on a range of volatile housing issues at the county board meeting last week.\nSupervisors face fierce critics of housing policy in the unincorporated areas they are responsible for, but they say the county board has no control over the housing program in other cities. \nThe big housing project \"we're all looking at\" in alarm, Rice said, is in Corte Madera   and the Corte Madera Town Council approved it.\n\"The Board of Supervisors had nothing to do with it,\" Rice said.\nCorte Madera officials approved the controversial 180-unit apartment complex in 2012, saying they were compelled to do so by state housing quotas.\nCorte Madera Councilwoman Diane Furst said later the town faced \"pressure from ABAG\" to provide \"244 units in our 2.7-square-mile tiny town\" and the council provided most of them at the former WinCup site.\n\"If we hadn't done that, we would need to put more than three 50-unit complexes around town, and I challenge anyone to explain where they might have gone,\" Furst said.\nThe development is now rising along the freeway at the old WinCup site on Tamal Vista Boulevard, with completion expected this summer. It has drawn protests from residents who are shocked by its size   and is being cited by critics elsewhere as an example of what could happen up and down the freeway.\nAt the same time she pointed to Corte Madera's accountability, Rice noted the county's own program, saying it \"set the track long ago\" for freeway development. She said a central premise of the countywide plan embraced 40 years ago is clustering development in a \"city centered\" corridor along with freeway, a policy that nurtures a rural environment in West Marin.\nSupervisor Judy Arnold warned that if the \"counter balance\" of freeway development is broken, the stakes could be high because zoning limiting development to one dwelling per 60 acres in West Marin can be eased.\nArnold also took the occasion to explain that Novato won state approval of a less intense zoning program than the county settled for because the city agreed to relinquish strict environmental overview.\nThe multifamily component of Novato's housing plan as approved by state officials calls for 20 to 23 units per acre, while the county's plan calls for up to 30 units per acre. Novato's plan, though, enables affordable development \"by right\" at the expense of local control, Arnold said.\nSupervisor Kate Sears also chimed in on a housing hot potato, repeating a pledge to put Strawberry's controversial \"priority development\" zoning designation on the county board's agenda next month. No date has been set.\nStrawberry residents want their community withdrawn from the development zone, but Sears has resisted, saying remaining in it paves the way for transportation grants. The county board withdrew Tamalpais Valley and Marinwood from the zone as urged by residents there.\nCitizen Marin, an organization opposing housing policies promoted by regional government, has urged a public discussion of the Strawberry zoning issue.\nSupervisor Steve Kinsey, noting discontent with housing policies, said protests are being driven by a \"blizzard of fear.\"\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

Once topping that hill his burden would roll down the other side and he would slowly descend the mountain to take up his fate once again.\nIt seems Sisyphus had upset the elders. In the day it was held that in order to make it in to heaven there had to be an elaborate wake, a ceremony of passing that would insure your state forever was as you wished. His wife, upon his passing, had cast his body into the street, thereby insuring his journey to Hades. Upon arriving there he beseeched the Gods of the underworld to allow him to return to earth to chastise his wife. Apparently they were convinced and he was allowed seven days on the surface. \nSisyphus journeyed across the lands to where his home was, but along the way some miraculous things happened.\nHe slowly walked the paths of his childhood, of his adulthood and he was awakened to the beauty that abounded around him, the sites he had never had time for. He was in awe of the blue sky, the serenity of the many streams and the wonder of the beauty in nature.\nFor the first time he was able to take in what was around him. He had been so busy before, working, managing, planning, executing, so focused on the obligations and required events of his life that he had overlooked the richness around him. So now as he took it all in, he lost site of his reason for being here and no longer desired to chastise anyone. He longed only to bask in the gifts of his world.\nWell the God of Hades would have nothing to do with an extended stay and sent his captors for Sisyphus, who was sentenced to his eternal punishment.\nPerhaps we might identify with his springtime awakening on his journey home. We, too, can be guilty of not appreciating the good that is around us everyday as we rush from one task to another, our thoughts consumed by obligation and the detail of the day. How often have we glanced up at the beauty around us? How often have we really appreciated what we have in our lives?\nSisyphus was conscious of the time between his burdens. He knew that his travail up would end and he would have the time during his walk down to appreciate his state in life.\nDo we appreciate our state in life? Do we actually see what is around us? Do we appreciate what we have?\nAll too often we are so concentrated on the negative that we overlook the positive, we are blinded by burden to the silver lining all around us.\nSisyphus had his rock and we have ours   job, relationship, grief, obligations, unavoidable tasks, loved ones in need, children unlaunched. But try to consciously see the time between your burdens as your time. A time to appreciate the goodness that is inherent in most of our burdens. Try hard to be aware.\nWalk outside; look up and all around. There is beauty in your life. This springtime I will try harder to appreciate it.\nHelp the world to be a better place by being aware of the goodness in our surroundings; recognize the potential in people, the beauty in nature, the blessings that are ours.\nDavid McLaughlin is a Novato resident.

Or which I yell at more frequently.\nReuben is a gorgeous Maine coon cat, huge and fluffy, who stalks the house like animal royalty. When he enters a room, people fall back in awe and admiration.\nThey always comment on how beautiful he is. Do cats understand human language? I'm sure Reuben internalizes every compliment.\n\"Yes, Reuben,\" I often say, \"yes, you are a wonderful cat.\"\nBut I often say, too, that he is an intolerable pest: if there's a key, a pencil, a piece of paper on a table, he nudges it onto the floor.\nI spend my life picking up.\nHe also jumps on the bed when I am trying to make it, and loafs on the dining room table when we aren't looking.\nSuch a clever cat.\nI am not a cat person; I have never yearned for a cat or any other pet. I love taking care of people   my husband, my sons   but never felt a need to tend to more. Life is busy enough as it is.\nSometimes, in the middle of the night, Reuben will land on our bed, spooking me completely till I realize who it is. Sometimes, if Rowland or I have neglected to serve his food or fill his water dish, he will whine until one of us gets up to take care of him. When it's I, the bedroom air is full of curses.\nMost of the time, Reuben is the sole occupant of our guest room. Rowland has installed maximum comforts and conveniences   a personalized food dish he bought in Maine, for instance, and a six-month supply of cat food and kitty litter.\nWhen guests come, his furnishings are transferred to our bedroom, where I am likely to fall over them during the night.\nAh, Reuben   you have taken over my life.\nRowland acquired Reuben before we were married, sending off to a kittery in Vermont for the largest specimen he could find. When I asked why he, as a widower, would burden himself with a pet, he said he felt the need to have some other creature to take care of.\nIf he had waited, I would have qualified, but alas, I was too late. When I got Rowland, I got Reuben, too.\nWhen he and I made plans to drive to Maine-and-back last summer, Rowland decided Reuben should go with us. Rowland created a huge cage in the back of our Prius, equipping it with an \"en suite bathroom,\" food and water dishes, and a toy or two to keep the cat amused. Rowland hauled him into our motels every night, and cleaned up the rugs every morning.\nI have to admit, Reuben was a champ. He slept through most of 9,000 miles.\nIn Maine, our landlords, who lived next door, fawned over Reuben and petted him whenever they visited.\nThis cat has the life of Riley. When he sits beside me, I can hear him purr.

Experts cite the lack of foreclosed homes for sale, homeowners waiting for prices to go up even further and the scarcity of new home construction as causes, among other things. \nThe problem can be self-perpetuating, agents said.\n\"People hesitate to sell their homes because they don't know how they would fare when they become buyers,\" said Eric McFarland, an agent with Pacific Union. \"Inventory is so low, when good properties come on the market it gets competitive, with multiple offers.\" So potential sellers don't list their homes, further limiting the number of homes for sale.\nWhile the multiple-offer situation has eased in recent months, Morgan is all too familiar with multiple bidding from other buyers competing for the same place.\n\"A house went on the market in San Rafael for $1,300,000. We offered $1,425,000, but there were 10 other offers, and it went for $1,650,000,\" said Morgan, who is a banker.\nIn December 2010, there were 952 homes on the market in Marin. By December 2013, the number was down to 283, a 70 percent drop, according to data from Bay Area Real Estate Information Services, a multiple listing service.\nThere were 2.3 months of inventory available in December 2013, meaning that if no new homes went up for sale, it would take just a little more than two months to sell every home on the market. Normal inventory in Marin is about four months' worth.\n\"In the fourth quarter of 2010, 25 percent of all the properties for sale in Marin were in contract,\" said Patti Cohn, an agent with Pacific Union. \"In the fourth quarter of 2013, it was 52 percent. The percentage of all homes on the market that sold was 28 percent back then, versus 60 percent now.\"\nOne of the reasons for the low supply could be that \"homeowners may simply be hoping that house prices will continue to rise, allowing them to recover lost equity,\" said John Krainer, a senior economist in the economic research department of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.\n\"It is well-documented that house price changes are persistent,\" meaning that price rises are likely to be followed by more rises, Krainer said. Those homeowners who don't have to sell right away \"can potentially take advantage of this. They may want to wait and gamble that the increases will continue, allowing them to sell later at a higher price.\"\nData collected in April 2013 by real estate sites Zillow and Corelogic shows a correlation, with the phenomenon, \"though not necessarily causation,\" Krainer said.\n\"Counties that experienced large increases in house prices over the past year also experienced relatively large declines in inventories available for sale,\" Krainer said. The median price in Marin zoomed by as much as 26 percent month-over-month in 2013.\nA local agent echoed Krainer's analysis.\n\"I think people are just hoping if they wait a little bit longer that their home will be worth a little more,\" said Alva Falla, an agent with Coldwell Banker.\nAnother factor: \"The foreclosure pipeline is drying up,\" Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist of the California Association of Realtors, asserted early last year. The trend has continued, both in Marin and across the Bay Area.\n\"A lot of the inventory was driven by short sales, and fewer short sales are coming on the market,\" said George Crowe, a real estate agent with Alain Pinel in Corte Madera. A short sale is when a property is sold for less than what is owed on the mortgage.\nAndrew LePage, an analyst with real estate information company DataQuick, also mentioned \"relatively little home construction.\"\nAlong those lines, \"There's high demand for houses, a huge amount of dedicated open space and a strong no-growth policy,\" Cohn said. As just one measure, 185,400 acres, or 55.6 percent of county land, is under permanent protection, according to Greenbelt Alliance.\nA bottleneck in the luxury market could be chalked up to psychological factors, according to one luxury agent.\n\"Desirable properties in places like Ross, Kentfield, Belvedere, Tiburon and Mill Valley are in short supply,\" said Tracy McLaughlin, a major shareholder in Pacific Union. \"Those people who would normally be willing to sell their $3.5 or $4 million homes to move up to $5 million homes   the real estate crash, and the bad economy, are too fresh in their memories.\n\"They've decided they can take their house and renovate it. They're saying, 'I don't need to build a monument to myself, we just saw what happened to the world four or five years ago.\n\"The people in the $2.5, $2.7 million homes who want to move up to the $4 million houses can't do so because those people are not selling. My buyer board now must have 35 people on it and I can't get them into homes. It's frustrating,\" the agent said.\nWith interest rates still at historical lows, tight supply and cheap money, \"I don't know that there's ever been a better time to sell,\" McLaughlin said.\nMore homeowners may soon come to the same conclusion, others said.\n\"We do expect to see new homes coming on the market over the next two months, tracking seasonal trends. Stagers are busy now, which is a good indication of future inventory,\" said Barr Haney, an agent with Pacific Union. Stagers decorate and furnish homes for sale in the most attractive manner in hope of piquing buyers' interest.\n\"The inventory dips in late November, December and January, but we always start to see it pick up in February, March and April, regardless of the market,\" Haney said.\n\"I suspect that more houses will come onto the market as times get better,\" said Krainer. \"To the extent that the recovery continues apace I would expect housing inventory to increase.\"\nContact Janis Mara via email atjmara@marinij.com .

You never have to worry about Karl. ... He's working hard.\"\n\nBeckmann should have all competitors on notice after winning the MCAL title last year.\n\n\"I went down to Wrestling Prep (training facility) in San Jose a lot more this offseason,\" Beckmann said. \"In the preseason I woke up at 5 a.m., ran to a friend's house, lifted weights and then ran back.\"\n\nIt's that kind of work ethic, which seems crazy to some, that got Beckmann interested in the sport in the first place. \nBeckmann was playing soccer as a freshman and saw the wrestling team going through its conditioning regimen. He wanted to give it a shot because it looked challenging.\nIt's certainly lived up to what he expected. \"It's even harder than it looked,\" Beckmann admitted.\n\nBut Beckmann is only one wrestler, a part of the team, and while he can lead he still needs a coach to guide him.\n\nBrielmaier is the head coach and nobody questions that. But Brielmaier has had a workload increase   he works for the U.S. Coast Guard   and has had less time to dedicate to the team.\n\nThat's where Steve Madson stepped in.\nMadson has taken on a lot of the responsibility and Brielmaier certainly loves what he brings to the table.\n\n\"He's arguably one of the best coaches in Northern California,\" Brielmaier said. \"He's quiet, not very outspoken, but he has the ability to bring the most out of the kids.\"\n\nThe last name Madson and Novato wrestling have become synonymous over the past several years in part because of his daughters, Courtney and Carissa who were both standout wrestlers for the Hornets.\n\nOver her three-year reign at Novato, Carissa amassed a record of 95-1 to go with three NCS titles at 122 pounds along with a state title she won last year.\n\nMadson is not wrestling this year because she is focusing in on her pole vaulting career which is what she will pursue at the collegiate level according to Brielmaier.\n\nBut nonetheless, her father continues to impart knowledge on the Hornets.\n\n\"He's a great coach,\" Beckmann said. \"He really has an incredible technical knowledge of wrestling.\"\n\nThat's exactly the kind of knowledge Beckmann is looking for.\n\nOutside of wrestling, Beckmann really only has time to keep his grades high   he had a 4.0 grade-point average last semester. Because of the time crunch keeping those grades puts him in, it makes the time he has at practice with Madson all the more important.\n\n\"I just have to keep working on the basics,\" Beckmann said. \"I have to have a few moves and shots that I've perfected and be in great shape. I have to be mentally ready to dominate anyone I wrestle.\"\n\nAs for reclaiming the MCAL title, both Beckmann and Brielmaier echoed similar sentiments.\n\"We have unfinished business,\" Brielmaier said. \"Karl ran through the league last year and he's looking a lot better this year.\"\n\n\"Winning MCALs is certainly a goal again, but I'm looking past it toward NCS now,\" Beckmann said. \"We have a ton of guys with a ton of potential.

The search also revealed purses, cellphones, tools and consumer electronics that appeared to be stolen and were covered with bits of glass, Pittman said.\nThe deputy also found ammunition in the car, a violation of the suspects' parole conditions.\nThe arrest histories of Coats and Salen includes an incident last month after a suspicious fire at their residence on Sunnyside Drive in Turlock, according to the Turlock Journal newspaper. After the fire, investigators found allegedly stolen property such as tools, credit cards, driver's licenses and Social Security cards, the newspaper reported.\nCoats and Salen were arrested under similar circumstances last April in Pleasanton, where police stopped a suspicious car and found allegedly counterfeited bills inside, according to the Pleasanton Weekly newspaper.\nCoats' criminal history also includes 2010 convictions for auto theft and residential burglary and a 2004 conviction for auto theft, according to the Stansilaus County District Attorney's Office.\nContact Gary Klien via email atgklien@marinij.com orhttps://twitter.com/GaryKlien\n -\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Heather Victoria Salen (Stanislaus County Sheriff Deptartment photo)\nDaniel Allen Coats (Stanislaus County Sheriff Deptartment photo)", "author": "By Gary Klien", "title": "Marin burglary suspects arrested after deputy intercepts suspicious truck"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Dick Spotswood: Is $18 million Larkspur bike path worth its price tag?\n\n\n\n\nSOMETIMES even a good idea costs too much to make it worthwhile. The latest example of this truism is the Marin Board of Supervisors' approval of a $9,391,938 construction bid to build a bike bridge, extending the North-South Greenway across Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.\nThe Greenway is the planned bike and pedestrian pathway running from the Golden Gate Bridge north to Sonoma County. \nIt's a good concept. Unfortunately, in this section alone, taxpayers will spend $10 million, including contingencies, to erect a 291-foot-long bridge and build a 700-foot-connecting path.\nAdd $8 million in pre-construction expenses and it's an $18 million project.\nThat's obscene.\nAssume that 75 percent of this $18 million is devoted just to the bridge and a circular ramp leading to the south side of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. That works out to about $45,000 per foot.\nWorried about greenhouse gas emissions?\nConstruction projects of this magnitude generally produce more greenhouse gases than will be saved by those who, due to this bridge, bike or walk instead of drive.\nThis project isn't even in the best interest of bicycling proponents.\nBecause the money comes from a federal Nonmotorized Transportation Pilot Project grant, the cash could have been better used for other Greenway projects that get far more bang for the buck.\nSupervisor Kate Sears touts that a major reason she supports the Priority Development Area designation, enabling construction of high-density housing in Strawberry, is that it may generate $251,000 in transit funding. It's perplexing that Sears sees a $251,000 grant in Strawberry as big bucks, but then votes to spend $9.4 million for a bike bridge over one street.\nThe concept of applying a cost-benefit ratio never arose during the five minutes that the board devoted to accepting Ghilotti Bros. Inc.'s low bid. After the usual round of self-congratulations, supervisors unanimously approved the expenditure on Supervisor Steve Kinsey's motion.\nThis fiasco is all due to a flawed process.\nThe project's basic goal makes sense.\nThe current multiuse path through the new $25 million Cal Park Hill Tunnel ends above Larkspur Landing's cinema. The idea is to extend the path across Sir Francis Drake. The hope is that someday the Greenway will somehow cross Corte Madera Creek and link with the Sandra Marker Trail.\nProjected bicycle and pedestrian utilization of the bridge is limited. Transportation Authority of Marin's travel model \"anticipates that 69 bicyclists and 12 pedestrians are likely to use the connection during the weekend morning peak when it opens in 2014.\" Weekend counts are far higher than on weekdays.\nThe flaw is that as the bike bridge project went forward no one really knew what it would cost, but everyone had an idea how to make it better.\nThe design of the bike-pedestrian bridge is stunning, but that decision cost real money.\nThe bike bridge will be on bay mud, requiring piers drilled down to solid rock. The environmental permitting process, even for a green-friendly bikeway, is expensive. Add accommodations to satisfy Americans With Disabilities Act requirements and we have a $10 million job to cross a 100-yard-wide gap.\nGiven the lengthy list of requirements imposed on the project's bidders, the $9.4 million low bid was reasonable. After all, the high bid was $11.5 million.\nSupervisors, when they first learned the potential cost, should have either considered a \"no project\" alternative or gone back to the drawing board.\nThen they could have devised a solution that while less elegant would have been cost effective.\nColumnist Dick Spotswood of Mill Valley now shares his views on local politics twice weekly in the IJ.

Offensively, the Penguins struggled the rest of the half with just three points coming from within the perimeter   a Connor Haysbert layup and a Myles Carrillo free throw. Despite shooting just 32 percent and being outrebounded 19-13, the Penguins trailed just 30-23 at intermission. \nA Carrillo three-pointer cut the lead to four to come out the gates in the second half but the Sea Warriors (11-3, 6-2) answered with 10 consecutive points that saw the Penguins trailing 42-26 with 14:06 left in regulation. The deficit grew to 17 before Dominican made an 11-2 run to cut the lead to 59-53 with two and a half minutes to play. A Haysbert free throw cut the lead to three with under a minute to go. A pair of Malte Ziegenhagen free throws pushed the lead back to five and Christopher Schwartz-Edmisten answered with one of his career-high five three-pointers. The lead again grew to four, and Schwartz-Edmisten sank a pair of free throws to put the deficit back at two. Then, Devin Golston nearly picked off a pass at midcourt but Leif Rodney was able to breakway, forcing Golston to wrap him up instead of giving up the easy basket. That plan backfired with Golston being called for an intentional foul, which resulted in a pair of Rodney free throws and the ball back to HPU. A Ziegenhagen free throw yet again pushed the lead to five and a Dominique Taplin three-pointer with 1.1 seconds put the lead at two. The Sea Warriors aired a pass out to run the clock out.\nSchwartz-Edmisten came off the bench to lead all players with a career-high 19 points on 5-of-8 shooting from deep. Carrillo added 17 points, also going 5-of-8 from deep, which was a career-high for him as well. Golston scored 14 points and made three three-pointers. Haysbert led all players with eight rebounds.\nThe Penguins attempted 55 field goal attempts, 29 of which came from deep. The Penguins shot 36.4 percent (20-of-55) from the field but went 51.7 percent (15-of-29) from past the perimeter. Conversely, HPU shot 59.1 percent (26-of-44) from the field, including an astounding 68.4 percent (13-of-19) in the second half. Both teams attempted 20 free throws with HPU making one more, 13-12.\nDarry Jones Jr. was one of three Sea Warriors to reach in double digits and scored a team-high 18 points on 7-of-10 shooting.\nDominican women fall short\nThe Dominican women's team gave third-place Hawai'i Pacific a scare but was unable to complete a near-comeback in a 79-78 Pacific West Conference loss.\nThe Penguins (2-14, 2-8 PacWest) trailed 46-34 at halftime and by as much as 13 in the game. A Carly Holboke basket kicked off a 14-5 run that cut the lead to three, 62-59, just under the 10-minute mark. The Penguins had big stops at the defensive end, thanks in large part to the season-high six blocks by Sarah Nelson. Still, the Sea Warriors (10-4, 6-2) pushed the lead back to seven on the backend of a Laken McClelland free throw with 3:22 to play.\nA Danielle Yamauchi three-pointer and Salonika Quewon-Owens layup kept the Penguins within striking distance, down four points. A Nelson and-one made it a one-point ballgame with 41 seconds left. Shots didn't fall after that though, as three baskets wouldn't fall, including a good look by Quewon-Owens that would have won the game at the buzzer.\nQuewon-Owens led all players with a career-high 23 points, 19 of those coming in the second half as she had her way in the paint and around the rim most of the night. In addition to her six blocks, Nelson poured in 16 points and freshman Carly Holboke added 13 points. Nelson and Quewon-Owens both had double-doubles. Nelson had a season-high 11 rebounds and Quewon-Owens grabbed 10.

James, coming off his most recent regenerative procedure, averaged 29.5 points last year and signed another 20-year deal. Former-president Hillary Rodham Clinton celebrated her 300th birthday today by releasing her 52nd book, \"The Long View.\" And, believe it or not, Justin Bieber is back atop the Top 40 charts, this time with his duet with Dolly Parton, \"Boy Meets Girl.\"\nSound farfetched? Well, yes, of course, it is   Bieber and Parton just do not have complementary singing styles. \nBut, in all seriousness, while the topic of aging never gets old, the treatment of aging-related processes has seen a few fresh developments. People are living longer and, for the most part, living better. Although it is overly optimistic to read too much into recent headlines about humans living to age 500, it is nonetheless an exciting time in aging research.\nWhat follows then is a head-to-toe of selected advances, investigations and recommendations. Keep in mind that some of these are promising but far from proven, and that all of them ignore the question of whether anyone really wants to live in a world where people routinely live for a half a millennium or more.\n*\nThe head: While the body will eventually show signs of wilt, the mind need not soften. Neurobics   aerobics for the brain   likely have some benefit for people of any age. Think of these as throwing your habituated brain a curveball   walking backward on the treadmill or writing with your off-hand   and the benefit may lie in helping to ward off dementia.\nHard science-wise, some recent evidence weakly supports the use of two supplements in cognitive decline, vitamin E and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil). Consider the study on the effects of high dose vitamin E supplementation on the progression of moderate Alzheimer's disease published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The good news; high dose supplementation with vitamin E may help slow cognitive decline in Alzheimer's. The bad news: prior studies have associated vitamin E supplementation with an increased risk of death from any cause and the dosing in the Alzheimer's study was 2,000 International Units a day   well above the recommended daily dose of 400 IUs.\n*\nThe heart: Purely investigational here, but good news from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato about the potential of drugs to improve the function of the mature heart. Researchers reported that mice afflicted with age-related heart disease saw significant improvement in heart performance when treated for three months with an FDA-approved drug called rapamycin, an immunosuppressant drug currently used to help prevent organ rejection after transplantation. These findings, not yet reproduced in humans, do have potential implications for improving both lifespans and physical activity levels in the elderly.\n*\nThe deltoid (Upper arm): Vaccines. Yes, the elderly can benefit, too. The flu vaccine is a must of course, but older adults can benefit from other vaccines that prevent painful (shingles) and potentially deadly (pneumococcal) diseases.\n*\nThe gut: The evidence just continues to accumulate suggesting that all of us, and in particular the elderly, should avoid unnecessary antibiotics. Antibiotics are truly great, but are no good at treating some infections (such as those, like the common cold, that are caused by viruses) and if taken in these situations the potential for harm is much greater than the benefit. The potential for harm includes the growing epidemic of Clostridium difficile colitis. This is a messy and potentially deadly gut problem and one that you'd like to avoid.\n*\nThe joints: The technology of joint replacement has really taken off. My father, now in his 70s, was essentially renewed after a double knee replacement eight years ago. I hear many other such tales on a week-to-week basis. Be advised that some of these procedures are big ones (although minimally invasive approaches are becoming more commonplace) and certainly not risk-free, but they can make a huge difference in quality of life. The day may soon come when joint replacement is accomplished not through titanium alloy, but through stem cell inoculation.\n*\nThe skin: There's clearly big business in skin care, and there seem to be hundreds of products that promise to reverse its aging process. Botox provides temporary wrinkle relief and Retin A (tretinoin topical) may help, too, but some people cannot tolerate its drying effects. For most, the clear winner in effectiveness, but only if started early enough, is regular application of sun protection. For those looking for the experimental, a biochemical (a nonflavonoid polyphenol, to be specific) called resveratrol, found in grapes and red wine, has shown promise in reversing cell-damage in skin and other cells. The laboratory evidence for this chemical is alluring, but the actual benefit in practice needs more investigation. For those on statins who might be tempted to try this product, be advised that it may affect the way your body processes your medication. So, talk to your doctor first.\nThere you go; a quick head to toe on longevity topics. None will help you live to age 300, but that's probably just fine   I don't think any of us want to stick around long enough to be subjected to Parton and Bieber singing \"Boy Meets Girl.\"\nDr. Dustin W.

The new school and its classroom environment, which Josh found more serious, were \"refreshing.\"\nBut ultimately, it was up to him to make the most of the fresh start.\n\"You see me get up roll out of this bed, go to work every day. You have to take the initiative, to do the same thing,\" DeAndre told him.\nJosh took it to heart and took more ownership of his learning   devoting extra time after school to his work, going in for help more often and enrolling in the AVID program his junior year. He is now earning only C's and above, with history as his favorite subject.\nToday Broughton, who aspires to play collegiately, talks candidly about the lessons from that freshman year.\n\"I want to try my best. I learned that if you set your standards really low,\" he said, \"you'll get even lower than what you expected.\"\nWith MCAL play in full swing, the Hornets are hoping to set a new standard for their program.\nBroughton said the culture change has started in practice, where Strawbridge has preached hard work and accountability in his first season.\n\"There's no excuses,\" Broughton said.\n\"Everyone is believing in the system,\" Velasquez added, \"and becoming as one. We're doing the little things.\"\nThat has Novato right in the hunt for an MCAL tournament berth, while also gunning for a spot in the North Coast Section playoffs for the first time since 2005-06.\nAnd Broughton couldn't be more excited.\n\"(Making both) would be the best feeling ever,\" he said. \"Just to make a name for ourselves   that'd be better than anything that would happen to me individually.\"\nContact Ed Yevelev via email ateyevelev@marinij.com\nBROUGHTON STATS\n* Scoring: 18.4 points per game (second in MCAL).\n* 3-pointers: 31 makes, 1.7 per game (fifth in MCAL)\n* Free throws: 64/74, 86.5 percent\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Novato High basketball player Josh Broughton poses for a photo in Novato, Calif. on Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2014.

He was in Novato visiting his grandchildren, who later joined him in his booth at Finnegan's.\nThroughout the game, the restaurant resounded with yells, whoops and the clamor of fists pounding on the bar, to the point that the bartender had to extend a gentle reprimand about the latter.\nIn general, however, the employees were just as excited about the game as the patrons, with one waiter decked out in a red jersey with \"Kaepernick\" emblazoned across the back.\nHe wasn't the only one to extol the powers of the quarterback. A group of red-jersey-clad fans crammed into one booth raised their arms simultaneously and whooped in harmony after the first touchdown, chanting \"Kap! Kap! Kap!\" When the going got tough, one fan audibly begged, \"Pleeeeeeease, Kaepernick.\"\n\"It's great to see a young quarterback come into his own,\" Kinchley said. \"They've had a great season, particularly the second half.\"\nWatching from a booth with three friends, Jon Ruiz said, \"Some friends of mine couldn't get tickets to the game online or anywhere, so they went to Seattle to support their team. It's awesome to see that kind of commitment.\"\n\"Win or lose, this was the best matchup in years,\" said Tom Carew of Novato, who snagged a seat at the bar in front of the TV screen with his wife Anita.\nAs the last seconds of the game ran out, John Nickols of Novato sighed, \"We were robbed.\"\nLachman looked at the TV screen and said, \"Thank you for the ride, Niners.

Her goal, which she was required to reach by 7 p.m. Saturday or receive no funds, was $35,000.\nHer plan is to sell the cows' milk to an artisanal cheese maker that last year set up its creamery at the Thornton family ranch southeast of Tomales.\nAlong with the cows she wants to buy, Thornton in March plans to start milking 108 East Friesian sheep that she already has purchased. The cows would share the ranch with her dairy sheep and with her father Gary Thornton's Black Angus cattle and Dorset/Hampshire cross sheep, which both are raised for meat production.\nThornton smiled when she recalled that her first ancestors in West Marin ran a small dairy and sold the milk to cheese and butter makers.\n\"It makes me feel like I'm coming around full circle to what they did when they were here,\" she said.\nThornton's efforts have drawn boosters in part because of the difficulty in reviving North Bay dairy operations.\n\"In most cases, when a dairy sells out in our part of the world, they're gone for good,\" said Sam Dolcini, president of the Marin County Farm Bureau.\nHe speaks from experience. His own family, which had been dairy farming in Marin since the 1850s, also sold its herd in 2001. \"We could never figure out a way to get back in,\" he said.\nDolcini has been alerting friends to Thornton's Facebook and Kickstarter pages. He notes that the region has lots of city dwellers who buy artisanal products and who want to know what they can do to help local agriculture survive.\n\"Here is a very easy way to help,\" he said, pointing to Thornton's \"Boutique Cow Dairy\" campaign on Kickstarter.\nThornton's ancestors, the Marshall brothers, immigrated from Ireland and established the family ranch in 1852. Along with the dairy, they raised beef cattle, grew wheat and potatoes and in the 1870s built a hotel on Tomales Bay. The town of Marshall is named for them.\nWhen her grandfather died, Thornton's father needed to sell the dairy cows in 2001 to pay estate taxes. Thornton said her family was able to keep the ranch by eventually selling a conservation easement for the land to the Marin Agricultural Land Trust.\nAfter high school, Thornton attended Santa Rosa Junior College and graduated with an animal science degree from Chico State University.\nShe decided to raise dairy sheep after tasting sheep cheese during a study abroad trip to Italy. The cheese surprised her for its mild, creamy and complex tastes.\nBut sheep provide dairy milk only six months a year. The dairy cows will provide milk all year long.\nThornton said she will start by selling milk to Bleating Heart Cheese, a creamery operated at the ranch by owners Seana Doughty and Dave Dalton. Eventually she would like to branch out and make her own cheese and yogurt products under the brand of Marshall Home Ranch & Dairy.\nFor rewards, her Kickstarter campaigns will provide $100 donors with lunch on the farm partially catered by the Cowgirl Creamery Cantina. Those who donate $500 can name and \"adopt\" one of the Jersey cows. A $2,500 gift comes with a weekend farm stay.\nOn Wednesday, Gary Thornton stopped rounding up cattle long enough to say what he thought of his daughter's plans.\n\"Good for me. Good for the ranch. One more generation,\" he said.\nA few minutes later he handed his daughter and a visitor a pair of cattle sorting paddles, the better to drive the first wave of cows and calves across a farm yard and into a corral.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Marissa Thorton, 26, wants to restart the family dairy that was closed in 2001 after 160 years farming the their land near Tomales, Calif.

Griffin's mother grew up with King's mother, and Griffin and his mother stayed with King Sr. and his wife Alberta during the 1962 NAACP convention when both were delegates.\nOn Tuesday night Griffin will speak King's words as part of the Marin Symphony's \"American Dream\" concert. \nGriffin, a public affairs consultant and Bay Area media personality, wanted to come to the Marin City School to reach out to students to better connect them to King's legacy and to invite them to the Marin Symphony's free performance.\n\"When you talk to kids these days about Marin Luther King, you might as well be talking about the Lincoln assassination,\" he said. \"It's well out of their time frame. I get that. I hope this brings Martin Luther King more into focus for them.\"\nGriffin spoke to the group of more than 50 students about who King was and what he did for equality in the country.\n\"All the water foundations were segregated, all the movie theaters were segregated, and you couldn't go into certain places, he helped change all that,\" Griffin told the students. \"He was a pioneer for social justice. Not just for black people, but for everyone. You should be very honored to go to a school that is named for him.\"\nGriffin also played a clip of newsreel footage that captured King as he lead the fight for civil rights. It was an eye opener for students to see how the country was legally segregated as recently as 50 years ago.\n\"To see they had signs put up that say 'colored;' it was shocking to see,\" said eighth-grader Carla Canada, 13.\nAdded sixth-grader Daisha Duffin, 12: \"It's sad and depressing.\"\nAs part of the presentation some of the music that is being used for the Marin Symphony's \"American Dream\" concert was played for the students. As part of that performance, Griffin will read the words of King as part of Joseph Schwantner's \"New Morning for the World.\" The second part of the program continues with Aaron Copland's Third Symphony that includes the iconic \"Fanfare for the Common Man.\"\nStudents from the school were given complementary passes and free transportation to a Sunday performance at the Civic Center. A second performance is scheduled for Tuesday.\nThe music made an impression on the students.\n\"It was interesting, like how the music was calm and then it sped up,\" said Qiyamah Cook, 11, a sixth-grader.\nGriffin said he re-read Taylor Branch's work looking at King's history so he had a better sense of the civil rights leader's words in preparation for the piece.\n\"I wanted know who he is addressing and under what circumstances he spoke his words,\" Griffin said.\nMakaelah Bashir, 12, a seventh-grader, was impressed by the entire presentation at her school.\n\"It's good to hear someone's perspective who was alive when all that was going on,\" she said.\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\nif you go\nMartin Luther King \"American Dream\" by the Marin Symphony is set for 7:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Marin Center Veterans Memorial Auditorium.

To accomplish this, think of vegetables as clues to the season.\nSpring means it's time to harvest hardy perennials such as rhubarb, asparagus, sorrel and artichokes. These plants thrive in Marin County and can be planted from December through March with good harvests in the third year. Cool season annuals can be planted when soil temperatures range from 40 to 60 degrees. These plants include carrots, cabbage, broccoli, kale, potatoes, turnips, peas, fava beans, leeks and quick-to-mature greens such as spinach and lettuces. Crop harvests begin as soon as 30 days (lettuce) to 120 days (potatoes). \nIn May, warmer days approach and soil temperatures increase to 60 degrees or more. You can now plant warm-season crops, including corn, tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, pumpkins, squashes and beans. In warm growing conditions, you can expect to harvest beans as quickly as 60 days and pumpkins in 120 days.\nMarin's temperate climate affords a third planting opportunity from late July through September for cool-season vegetables. Because seeds germinate at different soil temperatures, use a soil thermometer to determine when to plant. Direct seed large seeded vegetables such as corn, squash, beans and peas as well as all root crops such as carrots, radishes, beets and turnips. Transplant vegetables you want to get an early start such as tomatoes.\nOnce planted, water your seeds gently keeping them consistently moist to ensure germination. To achieve growth, seedlings need consistent watering, soil nutrients and adequate pollination.\nTo understand the cultural preferences, life cycles and probable problems of vegetables, it helps to learn the families of common vegetables. Grow sheets for many vegetables can be found on the UC Marin Master Gardeners' website atwww.marinmg.org . Click on Backyard to Belly to learn about how and when to plant vegetables and which varieties thrive best in Marin.\nWhen planning your garden, include herbs and flowers with your vegetables. This practice not only adds beauty to your garden, but also it helps attract pollinators and repel hungry pests that might otherwise go after your crops.\nThe best companion planting practices are outlined in a chart at the end of the grow sheets on the website. Remember to place taller vegetables to the north so shorter ones get the six to eight hours of sunshine needed to produce. Edible crops need nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium to produce vegetables galore. Planting by vegetable family maximizes crop yield by allowing you to fertilize according to the needs of that plant family. It also helps with annual crop rotation and disease control.\nVegetable gardens are always in transition looking pristine one day and a bit forlorn the next week. Here are three simple steps that can help you keep your vegetable garden visually interesting through most of the year and producing vegetables galore:\n* Think seasonally selecting a mix of annual and perennial vegetables that you like to eat and plant according to soil temperature placing taller vegetables to the north.\n* Include herb and flowers with vegetable plantings. They help draw the pollinators, deter pests by attracting predators, and act as borders to provide structure and balance.\n* Interplant by vegetable family according to soil, fertilizer and water needs while respecting crop rotation requirements, especially important in the edible landscape.\nThe University of California Marin Master Gardeners are sponsored by UC Cooperative Extension.

But savvy is what someone learns after interacting with many people over many years. Savvy is recognizing the real, and savvy is also recognizing the phony. But I digress. \n\"I'll have champagne,\" she said, oblivious that I was busily engaged trying to clean up around her large handbag.\nThere are certain people who talk at you, regardless of whether you are talking to someone else, doing something else or even looking in their direction. For them common manners are for other, more common, folk.\n\"The best. I only drink the best,\" she said to no one in particular and to everyone in general.\nJust then a much older man, whom I guessed was her date, finally arrived through the crowd. He waited just a second for me to clean the adjacent spot to her before finally sitting down.\n\"I'll have a draft Bud,\" he said, folding the calloused hands of man who has worked very hard for a very long time.\n\"This place is pretty swanky,\" he said, turning to her.\nShe wasn't listening. She was already engaging with some other much younger guy on her other side who didn't appear all that enthusiastic about having a woman his mother's age chatting him up. Oedipus be damned.\nSometimes dates are a way to get to know somebody, and sometimes they are just a vehicle to get to a free dinner or free drinks. It can be a very enlightening experience.\nThe night progressed much in the same vein. He tried to talk to her, and she did everything to avoid talking to him. That's not to say that she didn't talk, she did   just not to him.\nShe talked to the waitress, me and anyone else that came within 10 feet of her. I mean talked at. She didn't have what anyone would classify as an actual conversation. But like manners, listening sometimes can be for other people too.\n\"Put that on our tab,\" she said, indicating for the first time some sort of togetherness on the part of the older man, but only after the object of one of her monologues ordered a chardonnay. Listening apparently did have a place.\n\"And honey,\" she said in my direction. \"Make sure it's the best.\"\nBy best, I believe she meant the most expensive, because no other qualifier was given.\nShe ran up quite a bill.

Two declined credit cards and a probable bad check later she was on her way.\nI was left with these thoughts:\n* Dance with the one that brung you is a very old saying, and one that someone her age should have been familiar with.\n* People who only want the \"best,\" often expect someone else to pay for it.\n* Oedipus blinded himself for his indiscretion. One sometimes wonders if he regretted not having deafened himself instead.\n* Technically speaking karma is reserved for the next life, but occasionally we do get a sneak peek.\n* Dating someone younger can make one feel youthful, but it can also make one feel very, very old.\n* Enlightenment can sometimes be overrated.\nJeff Burkhart is the author of \"Twenty Years Behind Bars: The Spirited Adventures of a Real Bartender\" as well as an award-winning bartender at a local restaurant.

I don't know what to worry about most   global warming or the Arctic vortex. Back east they're hoping for a little more global warming and out here we're asking for just a touch of Arctic vortex. Actually, I'd prefer a nice combination of the two   something like a pinch of vortex and a dash of warming.\nI wonder if we can just knock on the door of say, New Hampshire, and see if we can borrow a cup of water. They've got plenty of it back there. And, it's frozen, so it ships easily. A couple of minutes in the microwave and voila, we've got rain. \nCan't we all just get along?\nOf course what this whole weather phenomenon has done is get the zealots on both sides of the aisle up in arms. There is frantic gesturing going on in our nation's capital these days. One side of the aisle is pointing a finger telling us that if we don't start doing something about our atmosphere, Salt Lake City will soon be selling oceanfront property.\nOn the other side of the aisle, they're wagging a finger (they can't agree on pointing or wagging either), saying how can we have global warming when we're freezing our collective tushes off in the middle of a polar vortex?\nI don't really know, but I would guess you could ask the polar bear who's treading water in the Arctic Sea because his vortex has moved south and the only ice remaining is in the cocktails of the debaters in Washington.\nThis is only the opinion of one man whose scientific background consists of making farting sounds caused by the compressed air being released when the palm of the hand is held firmly against the armpit. Oh, and I did manage to salvage a C minus in Mrs. Pollard's high school physiology class. I'd have probably had a C, but I think running screaming from the classroom when asked to dissect a cow's eye caused her to reconsider my application for the Nobel Prize in science.\nPerhaps what's happening is that living in the technological age that we do, I suspect the polar vortex, which normally resides between Baffin Bay, Canada, and Siberia thought to itself, \"I am freezing my Arctic buns off in this hellhole, I think I'll take a little spin down the Eastern seaboard and show the nice people there why nobody lives up here except penguins and lovers of whale blubber.\nAll the while, global warming is sitting back watching all of this saying to itself, \"I'm good, I'll just wait for California to come floating over to me.\"\nIn the meantime, we look out the window at the beautiful weather here in the middle of winter, doing dances like the Miwoks did, and hoping that the skies open up before all vegetation dies and we've got coyotes knocking on our door asking to borrow a cup of mice.\nI'm lost. I just don't know what to do. I find myself caught between a vortex and Armageddon. The one good thing   you don't have to shovel Armageddon.\nIt'll rain sometime soon fellow Marinites, I promise. But, we're living in strange times. I could have sworn I heard a weather forecast that said, \"Fair today, tonight and Monday, early morning fog followed by light showers. Tuesday, it's raining frogs.\"\nIt's OK, the coyotes love 'em.\nI just don't know whether to blame the Arctic vortex or global warming.\nBarry Tompkins is a longtime sports broadcaster who lives in Marin.

It is essential to preventing the increase of so-called \"social\" trails.\nAllowing hikers to wander where they please is what created the huge network of unauthorized trails we now have. Whether called \"social,\" \"unauthorized\" or just plain \"illegal,\" getting rid of such trails is essential to restoring the environmental integrity of the open space preserves and protecting both plants and wildlife.\nThis is what the plan is all about.\nAs long as any users are permitted to wander where they will, the number of these unauthorized trails will continue to increase   and it is not only hikers who will be making them and using them.\nThis change would not have happened without the tacit approval, if not the express direction, of the supervisors in their capacity as the board of the Open Space District.\nIt was a bad move and should be reversed.\nDelos Putz, San Geronimo\nConservation is right\nLuke Mazur of Belvedere (Readers' Forum, Jan. 16) makes it all seem too easy.\nBased on a series of unsupported conclusions, he arrives at the \"real answer\" for our water shortage.\nWith true nonchalance, Mr. Mazur concedes that \"conservation will help\" but he promptly makes the fallacious argument that Marin County \"continues to grow\" (though our population growth is barely 2 percent) so our need for water will likewise increase.\nHe warns us that \"serious conservation efforts\" require a \"moratorium on growth,\" and that means a \"loss of jobs.\"\nNo facts, no analysis, just conclusions.\nAs if one might just snap his fingers, the proposed \"real answer\" is to simply \"increase the supply of water\" and (especially for those who are not concerned about money or environmental responsibility), \"let the users pay the cost.\"\nJust having the money to pay for water isn't the point and it certainly isn't the answer.\nSmart and \"serious conservation efforts\" is where we are all heading and that may even create some jobs for those who care.\nLawrence Kaplan, Mill Valley", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 19"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "THERE IS LITTLE   if any   disagreement that visitation to Muir Woods National Monument on peak days creates traffic backups and parking congestion on the access roads leading to this popular national park. \nThe National Park Service shares the interest of neighboring communities in finding ways to alleviate this problem and we have proposed a reservation system for parking spaces and shuttle seats.\nThis will help us manage transportation capacity at Muir Woods in ways that address the needs of our visitors and our neighbors during peak weekends and year-round.\nThe proposal is not an attempt to add visitors to Muir Woods.\nWe are approaching this traffic and parking issue as we have so many others in the past: with an unwavering commitment to work with the community to find the right solution.\nWhen the reservation system was first proposed, a parking lot on Panoramic Highway was also mentioned as a way to get cars off the immediate access roads to Muir Woods. Many people reacted negatively to this idea, and as a result, it has been taken off the table.\nFor several decades   working with many county, state, federal and community partners   we have made major strides in the health of the woods by creating eco-friendly trails and boardwalks to protect the roots of the giant redwoods, the banks of Redwood Creek and the forest floor.\nWe have instituted measures to restore quiet to the forest. We have supported numerous scientific studies of salmon and spotted owls, and have created a three dimensional database of every tree in the forest.\nIn the past few years, the National Park Service and its partners have invested more than $10 million to return Redwood Creek to its natural state, in one of the most inspiring and comprehensive restoration projects ever undertaken by the service.\nManaging visitor access and reducing related impacts to protect Muir Woods can best be accomplished with input from the public, and in partnership with the county of Marin, California State Parks, and Rep. Jared Huffman's office.\nWe have years of successful collaboration to build on.\nThe popular shuttle system instituted seven years ago was developed in this collaborative way, as were the changeable signs on Highway 101, the new sustainable Dias Ridge Trail, and the ongoing efforts to slow down traffic and remove parking on lower Muir Woods Road.\nIf we work together, we can significantly reduce the chronic traffic and parking problems in the Tam Valley-Muir Woods corridor.

It does, however, have within it a serious worry   public employees right to massively shut down services as part of contract negotiations.\nThe lid on this Pandora's box, however, has been pried open by the Detroit bankruptcy proceedings, by the recent BART strike, and by the publication by Citizens for Sustainable Pension Plans of its study, \"Pension Roulette.\" \nThis study quantifies and describes the union-wrought financially burdensome public pensions throughout Marin County.\nInterestingly, the opening of this Pandora's box has resulted in a consensus   left, right, middle, and even some union members agreeing that a fix be instituted to reign in out-of-control pension costs and limit the additional potentially devastating risk from bad markets or investment choices all of which are shouldered by municipalities.\nCosts and risks which, exacerbated by improving mortality and recent decade long low portfolio investment returns, will, if unrestrained, in time eat its own, be they pension beneficiaries, taxpayers, union management or elected officials.\nHow can such a broad consensus occur in our contentious age?\nSome who peered into the box with little due diligence pointed a finger at those who did the homework and accused them of creating specious numbers. Others worried the authors were fronting persons with alleged sinister motivations.\nStill others were simply aghast and, in fear for their own well-being, tried to close the lid.\nThe numbers in \"Pension Roulette,\" however, are simply those reported by CalPERS and Marin cities and towns and the county. No one to date has challenged them.\nIn logic, one axiom is that things equal to the same thing are equal to each other. Those who peered into the Pandora's box of public pension plans and were shocked are in complete logical harmony with those who studied its contents.\nNone of us liked it and therefore as a matter of logic agree public pension plans, as presently constituted, can be financially rapacious and self-defeating.\nLooking into the box initially may have seemed small and inconsequential, but unfortunately, those peering have discovered financial and public service consequences that are severe and far-reaching.\nWe have passed the tipping point of consensus on the adverse impact on municipal finances of public pension plans. Even unions should recognize it is better to compromise early on than risk court action like Detroit's that puts pensions and their own existence at peril under federal bankruptcy law.\nThe challenge before us is not whether to make changes, but how to go about it.\nThe \"California Rule\", however, is a straightjacket that prevents willing parties from negotiating needed adjustments. This law prohibits the reduction of promised pension benefits unless offset by comparable new advantages.\nNonsensically, a public employee must be fired, salary reduced, stripped of medical benefits or his employer bankrupted for lack of an alternative because cost-of-living compounding, salary spiking, rich benefit factors, 1-3 year final salary periods and near-full retirement as early as age 50, cannot legally be diminished.\nUnions, employees and employers are all tightly constrained by this rule. Local governments   taxpayers   are on the hook.\nSan Jose Mayor Chuck Reed's initiative for the November 2014 election overturns the California Rule, giving all parties an important new tool, negotiating flexibility needed to keep pensions viable.\nCommon sense suggests all parties come together in support of Mayor Reed's initiative.\nBob Benbow of Tiburon and Bill Monnet of Sausalito are members of Citizens for Sustainable Pension Plans, the Marin organization working toward public pension reforms.", "author": "By Bob Benbow and Bill Monnet Guest op-ed column", "title": "Marin Voice: Marin's public pension policy banks on a Pandora's box?"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "You'd be hard pressed to find anyone who gets more excited about going to the library and sitting down with a good book than Bennie, a 4-year-old from San Rafael.

No one was injured and no homes or structures were threatened.\nAided by cool temperatures and little wind, firefighters had the fire 50 percent contained by Saturday morning, limiting it to burning one acre. The Fairfax-Bolinas Road was closed through the day on Saturday while crews finished dousing the scorched brush and trees.\n\"The vegetation in the area is extremely dense,\" said Marin County Fire Department Battalion Chief Mike Giannini. \"This made it difficult to access and subsequently to extinguish all the hot spots.\"\nGiannini said the department was able to bolster its fire fighting force with returning seasonal firefighters.\n\"We put 75 people on it, so that and the combination of light wind allowed us to keep it as small as we did,\" he said. \"We can't prevent every fire, but if we keep it from spreading, then we've done our job.\"\nAs a precautionary measure, the burn area was to be patrolled Saturday night and into Sunday morning to guard against any possible flare-ups.\n\"We are seeing conditions that we would normally see during the summertime,\" said Fire Chief Jason Weber. \"The humidity is extremely low and the vegetation is extremely dry.\"\nSeven engines and two water tenders were used to shuttle water to the affected area.

But 30 years later and one conference change later, Beales, who lives in Novato, finds himself rooting against his neighbors, as his Seahawks face off against the 49ers Sunday in the National Football Conference Championship for the right to play in the Super Bowl. \n\"I haven't really been anti-Niners in the years that followed\" the allegiance switch to the Seahawks, Beales said. \"Except when they face off.\"\nBeales, a fourth-grade teacher at Bacich Elementary School in Kentfield, stuck out on campus Friday, which was deemed \"Red and Gold Day\" by the principal, to show support for the home team leading up to the weekend's matchup. While most teachers and students wore 49ers garb, Beales dawned his blue-and-green Seahawks jersey, with the number 31 on it   a replica of the jersey worn by Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor.\n\"I've worn my colors with pride through the rough years,\" Beales said. \"I certainly have no problem wearing my colors now.\"\nWhile Beales was a black sheep on Friday, he won't be the only Marin resident rooting for the Seahawks on Sunday.\nCaitlin Smith, 40, of Mill Valley has a more natural reason for following the Seahawks. She was born and raised in the Seattle area.\n\"My best friend since the seventh grade and I would watch the Seahawks every Sunday,\" said Smith, who has lived in California since 2000.\nBeales and Smith, who do not know each other, both said they don't know of many other Seahawks fans in the Bay Area. But there is evidence that others do live among the 49ers faithful.\nJamie Lanier, manager of the Lids hat store at San Rafael's Northgate mall, said the store has sold around 35 Seahawks hats since the playoffs started. Most of them, she said, were bought by adults with rooting interests, as opposed to teenagers who might buy them more for fashion purposes.\nSmith said she sees people wearing Seahawks attire occasionally. Once, while wearing a Seahawks shirt during a hike, she crossed paths with a runner who was also wearing a Seahawks shirt. She said they nodded, as if they were part of a secret society.\nCertain NFL teams have national appeal. Fans of the Dallas Cowboys, Pittsburgh Steelers and Green Bay Packers are easy to find anywhere in the country. Seahawks fans, on the other hand, tend not to stray too far from the Space Needle.\nThat's partly because the franchise has only been around since 1976. Just four of the NFL's 32 teams have come into existence after the Seahawks.\nFurther suppressing growth of the Seahawks' fan base is the franchise's location, in the remote Pacific Northwest, and the lack of success over the franchise's 38 seasons. The Seahawks have reached the Super Bowl once, in the 2005 season, when they lost to the Steelers.\n\"For so long, it wasn't necessarily so exciting to be a Seahawks fan,\" Smith said.\nIt hasn't been all bad rooting for the Seahawks. They have finished first in the NFC West division   the same division the 49ers play in   eight of the past 11 years. But, with no Super Bowl victories, compared to San Francisco's five, Seattle fans are left yearning for that ultimate prize.\nBoth Beales and Smith cite Jim Zorn, Steve Largent and Curt Warner (the running back, not the quarterback who spells his name, \"Kurt\") among their all-time favorite players, from a time when the Seahawks played in the American Football Conference. (They switched conferences in 2002.) Both cite Russell Wilson, Chancellor and Oakland native Marshawn Lynch among their favorite current players.\n\"I think it's an interesting team,\" Smith said. \"They're pretty feisty, but a lot of fun to root for.\"\nBeales goes a step further with his fanhood, drawing a distinction between the teams' head coaches.\n\"I don't really like (Jim) Harbaugh,\" Beales said of the 49ers head coach. \"He's a good coach, but I'm glad he's not my coach.\"\nHe said he's happy that Pete Carroll, whose personal rivalry with Harbaugh extends back to their days of coaching college football, is his team's coach.\n\"I really like his vibe,\" Beales said of Carroll. \"He's honest. He's forthcoming. I don't sense that with Harbaugh. He's much more terse with the media.\"\nBeales also has a personal connection with the Seahawks these days. Cooper Helfet, who grew up in Kentfield and was a star athlete at Redwood High School, is on Seattle's practice squad   a designation for reserve players who are not on a team's active roster but are employed by the team. Beales coached Helfet in lacrosse in the early 2000s, when Helfet was in middle school.\nWhile rivalries on the field occasionally lead to hostile interactions between opposing fans off it, Beales and Smith said 49ers fans in Marin have been amicable.\n\"I've never gotten bad looks,\" Smith said. \"People are generally nice.\"\nBeales said he and his Niner-loving friends exchange taunts, but \"it's always in fun.\"\nIf the Seahawks beat the 49ers, and the New England Patriots defeat the Denver Broncos in Sunday's other conference championship game, a Seahawks-Patriots Super Bowl will give Smith another rooting conflict. Her husband, who is from Boston, is a Patriots fan.\n\"We might need to be in separate rooms,\" she said.\nContact Laith Agha via email atlagha@marinij.com\nRIVALS PLAY FOR TITLE\nSunday's conference championship between the 49ers and Seahawks kicks off at 3:30 p.m. in Seattle\n* On the air: TV, Channel 2.

They were on the verge of retiring in enviable comfort.\nOn Wednesday, they'll be in San Francisco for a last look at the con man who took it all away.\nEngel, 69, and Wold, 70, formerly of Tiburon, are the victims of the convicted scammer known as Blessed Marvelous Herve. His scheme cost the couple $1.6 million and left Wold with about $200,000 in tax debts.\nHerve, 42, is scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday morning in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. Engel and Wold are traveling to the hearing from Florida, where they now share a two-bedroom condo with Wold's sister. \nThe identities of Engel and Wold have been kept confidential by federal authorities, whose filings refer to them only as \"BE\" and \"KW.\" But they recently agreed to be interviewed, partly to demonstrate the devastation that a single schemer can cause, even to a couple who considered themselves sophisticated.\n\"This guy wiped me out,\" said Engel, who is now selling Volkswagens in Stuart, Fla., a town about 100 miles north of Miami. \"We absolutely believed this guy.\"\nThe scam started in 2006 and lasted about six years. Engel was a real estate broker who had founded First Marin Realty three decades earlier. Wold was a retired schoolteacher who had worked for the Western Placer Unified School District.\nTheir fates turned when Engel listed an advertisement for a $6 million home in Tiburon. Herve responded to the ad.\nHerve, who claimed his father was the Republic of Congo's president, said his father wanted to pay cash for several luxury homes in the Bay Area, according to court documents. He said his father wanted to travel to the region to look at properties, but he would need to have bulletproof limousines provided for him.\nEngel agreed to give Herve the money to book the limos. But Herve's supposed father kept postponing the trips, prompting requests from Herve for more limo fees.\n\"Having taken about $30,000 from BE though the limousine aspect of his fraud, (Herve) set his sights on more of BE's money,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Sprague wrote in a sentencing memorandum. \"He told BE that the United States had seized $43,000,000 of defendant's money after defendant transferred it from Switzerland to San Francisco.\"\nEngel agreed to lend Herve money on promises of repayment with interest and bonuses. Engel parted with another $100,000 during this phase of the scheme.\nThen Herve claimed the U.S. government had filed a classified criminal case against him that involved the Patriot Act and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, authorities said. He told Engel he needed more money for his legal defense and living expenses.\nOver the next several years, Engel continued to give financial support until he had drained his entire $600,000 in savings, including a $100,000 inheritance from his mother.\nWith no more money to give, Engel turned to Wold, his longtime companion, for help fronting money to Herve.\n\"Defendant repeatedly claimed to BE and KW that he was near victory in his court case and thus the release of funds was imminent,\" Sprague wrote. \"But if BE and KW did not continue to support his case, he would lose and never pay them back what they had loaned him to date, let alone the interest and bonuses.\"\nWold agreed to help. She eventually put up even more money than Engel, covering Herve's living costs, cellphone bills and other supposedly critical expenses.\nBy the time the couple decided to report Herve to authorities, Wold had lost more than $950,000.\nHerve was finally arrested by the FBI last spring. He eventually pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.\n\"The victims' retirement accounts are gone, and they are at a point in life where they cannot replenish them,\" Sprague wrote. \"Both victims borrowed money from friends and family; that money is gone. The victims borrowed against insurance policies; that money is gone. The victims borrowed against their homes; that money, along with the two homes used to secure those loans, is gone. BE's entire inheritance from his mother ended up in the defendant's pocket. Both victims have had to return to work at times when they should be enjoying retirement.\"\nThe U.S. attorney's office is seeking a sentence of 37 months in prison and $1,605,926 in restitution, describing Herve as an unrepentant, chronically unemployed liar who just wanted to \"bleed\" the victims.\nHerve's lawyers, Ethan Balogh and Jay Nelson, paint a different picture. They describe Herve as a victim of circumstance whose mother died from complications of childbirth and whose father, a \"high-level government official in the Republic of Congo,\" was assassinated with the rest of his family during a period of political violence.\nAt the time of the unrest, Herve was a talented student of music at Azusa Pacific University, a Christian college near Los Angeles, his lawyers said.\n\"Although Mr. Herve managed to escape murder by happenstance of studying abroad, his life   which was previously categorized by peace and comfort   was upended, and he found himself stranded, alone, and penniless in a foreign land, unable to return home for fear of violent reprisal,\" the lawyers said in their sentencing memorandum.\nThe defense attorneys said Herve lost his student visa but was granted asylum in 1998, after which he moved to San Francisco, worked in service jobs and tried to launch a career in music. The lawyers submitted certificates of appreciation from various political figures   including Rep. Nancy Pelosi and two former San Francisco mayors, Gavin Newsom and Willie Brown   commending Herve for musical performances for charitable groups.\nIn addition, Herve's lawyers suggested that Engel's gullibility was a factor in the case and that \"the fraud was facilitated, at least in part, by B.E.'s own greed.\"\nNevertheless, Herve's lawyers are asking the judge for a sentence of 33 months, just three months fewer than the government is seeking.\nA spokeswoman for Azusa Pacific University said there is no record of a Blessed Marvelous Herve attending school there. Nor is there any record of students whose names match Herve's alleged aliases, Rodrique Herve Ndandou, Herve Rodrigue Ndandou and Blessed Roll Herve.\nAfter two postponements of Herve's sentencing, the government paid for a no-frills overnight trip for Engel and Wold to attend the sentencing. The couple will fly in on Tuesday, spend the night at a hotel at Fisherman's Wharf, and fly back after the sentencing Wednesday.\nLooking back on the scam during an interview, Engel said, \"I just can't believe I was so stupid.\" But he said he carefully checked Herve's various assertions \"right and left,\" and everything always seemed legitimate.\n\"He was extremely clever and never broke from his lies,\" he said. \"Sometimes it was uncanny what he knew. He got into me so deep.\"\nWold said the fraud has left her emotionally traumatized in addition to destitute. She described herself as someone who always worked two or three jobs to build up her savings, and now even her teacher's pension is being garnisheed for unpaid taxes and penalties stemming from her retirement account withdrawals.\nNow she is doing some volunteer tutoring in the hopes in might lead to a job. She said the worst part of her ordeal is the knowledge she will be unable to leave anything to her grandchildren.\n\"I have no other assets,\" she said. \"I am totally, totally ruined.\"\nContact Gary Klien via email atgklien@marinij.com orhttps://twitter.com/GaryKlien\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Blessed Marvelous Herve.

That plan would raise $83 million over five years.\nAnother calls for a $1 increase in April, then toll increases in the following five years. That would raise $138 million over five years. That would put the Fastrak toll at $7 and the pay-by-plate toll at $8 in 2018.\nOther options raise $117 million and $123 million over the five years. About 40 emails have come to the district since the toll increase options were announced, a majority voicing opposition to a hike, a bridge spokeswoman said.\nWith all-electronic tolls now on the bridge   all toll takers were eliminated in March 2012   the cost to cross could be raised by less than whole dollars if desired without fear of a traffic backup because no change has to be made.\nTolls were last raised by $1 in 2008. Fastrak users now pay $5 to cross the span, while pay by plate drivers pay $6.\nThe district has a projected five-year, $142 million deficit, up from a $66 million deficit in 2012. It would take a toll increase to reduce the projected deficit to a manageable level, according to the district.\nBridge officials find themselves grappling with a growing deficit and dwindling reserves and tolls appear to be the only option to get back into the financial black.\nPersonnel costs, the seismic retrofit of the span, a $75 million bill to help pay for the ongoing Doyle Drive upgrade, south tower painting and the partial loss of revenue from a downsized local bus contract with Marin County, have fueled the district's deficit, bridge officials said.\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\nIF YOU GO\nGolden Gate Bridge officials will hold a public hearing on a toll increase from 5 to 7 p.m. Tuesday in the Caboose Meeting Room at Whistlestop, 930 Tamalpais Ave. in San Rafael.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: A sign tells motorists to keep moving at the toll plaza of the Golden Gate Bridge on Wednesday, Mar. 27, 2013, in San Francisco, Calif.

Airport owners are also asking the council to increase the hours of operation for indoor activities   a proposal the defense council will not oppose under the agreement.\nSan Rafael Planning Manager Raffi Boloyan said the changes require additional City Council action. \n\"Some of the terms of the settlement agreement require a use permit amendment,\" Boloyan said.\nBob Herbst, manager of the airport, couldn't be reached for comment.\nRobert Dobrin, president of the Gallinas Creek Defense Council, was hesitant to comment on the settlement.\nThe city approved the project in December 2012 by a 3-1 vote, with Councilman Damon Connolly dissenting, after about seven years in the planning and public hearing process. The plan includes building a 86,000-square-foot building for soccer and gymnastics, plus outdoor turf fields, on a 16.6-acre site near Gallinas Creek, the airport and McInnis Park.\nThe Gallinas Creek Defense Council, a group of residents and organizations in the area, filed a lawsuit against the city, City Council and the project applicant, San Rafael Airport LLC, in January 2013, arguing the project had a lackluster environmental impact report. The group claimed there was insufficient analysis of the potential effects on noise levels, airplane safety, light emissions and the California clapper rail, a federally protected endangered species.\nThe settlement agreement addresses some of the group's concerns by adding infrastructure such as more aircraft warning lights to buildings, prohibiting any bleachers being built outside and shielding outdoor lights so they don't create glare. As part of the agreement, the sports facility will open its outdoor fields at 9 a.m. and close at 9 p.m., instead of allowing operations to last until 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. During the winter months the outdoor fields can open at 8 a.m.\nA loss of hours has prompted the airport to ask its indoor operations last until 11 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays and midnight on Fridays and Saturdays, instead of 10:30 p.m. and 11 p.m., respectively.\nBoloyan said the City Council had originally approved the longer indoor hours, but hinged the implementation on a one-year review. The longer hours were set to go into effect after a year of the complex's opening if residents of Contempo Marin and Captain's Cove weren't bothered by traffic noise.\n\"The airport owner is asking the council accelerate that allowance to reach the full hours now,\" Boloyan said.\nAs part of the settlement, the airport has given the city $20,000 that it must put toward participation in the Marin County Gallinas Watershed Program, which involves environmental restoration of the 5.6-square-mile Gallinas Creek watershed.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

We all grew up rooting for the 49ers. But this is bigger than that. We support him out of friendship.\" \nPete's Patrol, aka the FOPs (Friends of Pete), know Sunday's conference championship matchup between San Francisco and the Carroll-coached Seahawks is emotional. It will take a loss by the beloved 49ers for Marin County to have its first head coach in a Super Bowl.\nWinning the NFC championship would be a career achievement for the 62-year-old Carroll, who first studied the sport while playing defensive back and receiver for coach Bob Troppmann and assistant Al Endriss at Redwood during the late 1960s.\n\"I think, deep down, after 35 years of coaching, this is what he's been striving for all along,\" said Dave Perron, a sports and philanthropy program development expert from Corte Madera who was Carroll's teammate at College of Marin and worked with him on his foundation in Los Angeles.\n\"He is so about everyone else   the team, the players, how to win and compete the proper way. But I believe the chance to coach in the Super Bowl, is a big part of what he's worked to achieve.\"\nCarroll's friends admit they don't spend much time talking about Super Bowl dreams. He trades texts with his hometown buddies frequently, invites them to Seattle for a yearly VIP game experience and even called Endriss from the locker room before last Sunday's playoff victory over the New Orleans Saints.\n\"We kept it light. \"... We talked about the weather,\" said Endriss, a former 49ers player who coached in Marin for more than 50 years before retiring last spring. \"It was idle chat. But I told him how happy I was for him to be this close to the big one.\"\nCarroll's coaching career, which started as a graduate assistant at University of the Pacific in 1973, has led him to many big games. He was an assistant coach on the 1987 Minnesota Vikings team that lost the conference final to the Washington Redskins. At USC, the Carroll-coached Trojans played national-championship games in 2005 and '06.\nAccording to Carroll's friends, his parents Jim and Rita were his biggest fans. Both died in recent years.\n\"I wish they were still around to see this,\" said Bill Peters, the ball boy from Carroll's high school team. Peters' brother Jim was quarterback on Carroll's team. \"When Pete was coaching with Bud Grant in Minnesota, I remember Jim and Rita going to the Flatiron (San Rafael sports bar) and using the satellite to get the Vikings game.\"\nDiaz, who was a high school teammate of Carroll, remembers Jim and Rita's house as a gathering spot for the neighborhood.\n\"We spent morning, noon and night there. \"... We watched big games on their TV and used their pool table. The door was always open,\" Diaz said. \"It was a big group of friends and we did everything together. We went skiing. We went to the movies.\"\nLou Larsen is part of that group. Larsen   the force behind the Redwood Athletic Hall of Fame   organized trips to Seattle in recent years. Before the Oct. 13 game against Tennessee, a group inlcuding Larsen, Diaz, Don Meyer, Peters and his two sons, Steve Boro and his son traveled to Seattle. They spent time at the practice facility with the coach, ate lunch with former Redwood standout Cooper Helfet (now a player on Seattle's practice squad) and met with quarterback Russell Wilson.\n\"We all pulled our chairs around a big table (in the cafeteria at the Seahawks practice facility) and just started telling stories,\" Bill Peters said.\n\"Whenever we are together, we are always taking about the old days,\" Diaz said. \"But it isn't about him. We're remembering all kinds of stuff   that time so-and-so fell off the raft. Everyone is Tommy or Louie in those stories; just remembering our childhood.\"\nOn those visits, Carroll takes care of his crew. Pregame sideline passes are part of the package as well as good seats or a spot in a luxury box shared by the Carroll family and the team's general manager.\n\"Everybody gets a handshake and a hug. He's waving and playing catch with people in the stands,\" said Endriss of walking the field pregame with his former player. \"What you see is what you get with Pete. He's been that way since he was a young man. He's always had that smile and that enthusiasm \"... and he's never forgotten where he came from.\"\nCarroll's efforts in keeping his childhood friendships alive make it easy for his group to root for him against the 49ers this weekend.\n\"My dad was a charter season-ticket holder for the 49ers at Kezar Stadium. That place was our second home,\" said Skip Corsini, another high school pal of Carroll. \"But when Pete plays the Niners, I'm all for Pete.\"\nContact Dave Allen via email atdallen@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll poses with a group of his friends from Marin County at the team's training facility.

The store is filled with scarves, tunics, shoes, handbags, place mats, foil serving trays, candles and numerous other items. Many of the products are designed by Smith's employees and then produced overseas. \nThough she started her business right before the economic downturn, Smith's boutique has grown tremendously   now offering more than 800 products to 4,200 stores in the United States and 150 international accounts. She's even worked on custom projects for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Ballard Designs and Coldwater Creek.\nQ: So how did you get into the design field?\nA: I studied international relations in college, and I came to it more through a love of other countries and travel. I make all the final decisions on a product and I sit with the designers, but I don't actually draw, paint or design. We collaborate on everything. I love to travel so this business affords me the opportunity to travel all over the world.\nQ: Where are you able to travel?\nA: I go to Vietnam to source our foil trays or India to meet a supplier. I love to be able to meet people, go to their homes and help them grow their businesses. I love India. We had the most outrageously wonderful trip to meet our suppliers. They had us to their homes, their clubs, you name it. Vietnam is pretty amazing, too. The people are very kind, and the food is extremely good.\nQ: What advice would you give to people wanting to start a small business?\nA: It's important to know the size you want your company to be before you start. Then you can build the infrastructure you need. I had a five-year plan, and I invested upfront to support that volume. I think that's really important. Buy the expensive software and systems. And make sure you have plenty of cash. It's always more expensive than you think. It took us two years to become profitable.\nQ: How long have you lived in Marin County, and what do you like about the area?\nA: I'm from Philadelphia originally, but I moved to Marin in 1989. I was living in San Francisco and I came out here because of the Mulberry Neckwear business. Then I fell in love with Marin. I hike a ton on Mount Tamalpais. I love it. It's a pretty phenomenal place to live with my husband and two sons, one of which is at college.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Rockflowerpaper CEO Katie Smith stands in the company's store in San Anselmo, Calif. on Friday, Jan. 10, 2014.

His name is Ike Stubblefield, and, truth be told, I'd never heard of him. But then no one I spoke to around here knew that much about him either. And that's the way Stubblefield wants it.\nNever interested in being a star, he's a musician's musician, a super sideman, one of the industry's first-call masters of the Hammond B-3, the mighty organ that Al Kooper immortalized on Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone.\" \nOn Saturday, Sweetwater's Aaron Case featured the esteemed Bernard Purdie, \"the world's most recorded drummer,\" at the Mill Valley club. The 61-year-old Stubblefield is in the same mold, having played on countless records, including a half dozen Grammy winners. Case booked him after seeing him at Jazz Fest in New Orleans, sitting in with Widespread Panic. This is a return engagement.\n\"Having those guys here is like presenting living history,\" Case told me. \"Whenever living legends come through, whether they draw 300 people or not, there's value in getting them here.\"\nStubblefield will be playing with a trio that includes the young Welsh guitarist and songwriter Eddie Roberts, a member of the funky London foursome the New Mastersounds, whose latest album, \"Out on the Faultline,\" was recorded in San Francisco. So the gig brings together two generations of Blue Note-style funksters, the old master and the young turk.\nI managed to get Stubblefield on the phone at his home in Athens, Ga., just as he was packing to come out here for the Sweetwater show and a couple of others in Northern California. After talking with him for a while, I saw him as a kind of Zelig of baby boomer rock. The cat's played with everyone from Al Green to Frank Zappa.\n\"I've never been into just one genre of music,\" he explained. \"That's why I can walk onstage with Warren Haynes and Government Mule, or Widespread Panic, or Derek Trucks, and then cross the street and go sit in with a major jazz artist, or R&B band, or even a bluegrass group.\"\nA keyboard prodigy, he was touring with a Motown revue when he was 14, playing behind the likes of the Temptations, the Four Tops, Marvin Gaye, Martha Reeves and Stevie Wonder.\n\"It was a little daunting back then,\" he recalled. \"I came from a pretty conservative family in Toledo, Ohio, and the Motown people were all street folks from Detroit. They were nice to me, but they reminded me that I was a kid.\"\nSame thing when he ventured across the pond to back up Eric Clapton and Rod Stewart, both of them in the hotel-room-trashing part of their careers.\n\"Still being a kid, that was my first time living in another country,\" he said. \"And back then they were pretty messed up drug wise. That's why I didn't stay with them that long.\"\nWhile living in London, he also played with the Pet Shop Boys, Billy Ocean and the London Symphony. Along the way, he lost his naivete.\n\"To give you an idea, I used to hang out a lot with Freddie Mercury and Queen,\" he recalled. \"We would go to East Berlin when the wall was up and party.\"\nAfter Hugh Masakela surprised me a while back by telling me he was a Sausalito flower child in the '60s, I now expect everyone I interview to have some connection to Marin. And sure enough, Stubblefield lived in Stinson Beach during the post Haight Ashbury years he was on the Bay Area scene.\n\"Commander Cody was my neighbor,\" he remembered, then said, chuckling, \"Huey Lewis opened for me back then. When Merl Saunders couldn't do a Jerry Garcia Band gig, Jerry would call me. I sat-in with Electric Flag (Michael Bloomfield's band), a whole bunch of folks.\"\nEight years ago, while performing in Germany, he was asked to come to Paris to play a series of shows with Clapton, filling in on organ for Billy Preston, who had fallen ill. But Stubblefield was ill himself with what he thought was pneumonia, but was later diagnosed as lymphoma.\n\"I couldn't even make the first show,\" he said. Back in the states, he was treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. When chemotherapy and radiation didn't work, he had a bone marrow transplant that turned the tide.\nHe told his doctors that he had booked a gig in four months, and that he wasn't planning on missing it.\n\"I said, 'Let's get this done so I can get back to work,'\" he said. \"That's the mentality I had, and it got me through it.\"\nIn the past year, he's appeared on 29 records, including albums by Southern guitarist Jimmy Herring, Grammy-nominated Ruthie Foster and Grammy-winner CeeLo Green.\n\"I've never really wanted to be a star because I saw how it tore people apart as a kid, playing behind a lot of major people,\" he said. \"So I learned at an early age how to stay involved in the creative part of the industry without having to be the artist. When I go to the grocery store, nobody knows who I am. But major musicians know who I am.\"\nContact Paul Liberatore via email atliberatore@marinij.com ; follow him on Twitter athttp://twitter.com/LibLarge .

The park, one of the jewels of our national parks, should not be a headache for its neighbors.\nGetting stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic to enjoy the rich slice of nature that bears John Muir's name seems incongruous enough to beg for change and reasonable solutions. Creating traffic and parking problems for people who live on Mount Tamalpais, even those trying to use Shoreline Highway through Tam Valley, also seems to clash with the noble purpose of the park.\nNearly 1 million visitors take in Muir Woods each year and getting people and cars there has been a longstanding problem.\nSupervisors are urging the GGNRA to consider implementing a reservation system, similar to those used at other popular parks.\nThe county also has suggested that a transit system be used, similar to the county-run shuttle that now runs only during the summer   and at county expense.\nPoint Reyes National Seashore started a convenient shuttle bus taking visitors from the Drakes Beach parking lot to the lighthouse and Chimney Rock because those were becoming choked with parking and traffic.\nThe county's letter follows the park's decision to shelve its plans to build an overflow parking lot near the Dias Ridge trailhead.\nThat may be an answer to the problem, but it's not a solution.\nIt's time for the park, the county and the public to come up with viable solutions that will enhance rather than detract from the experience of visiting Muir Woods. We hope that Rep. Jared Huffman takes an active interest in this, as well.\nThose solutions should promote easy and affordable access to the park without causing headaches, either for immediate neighbors or motorists who need to use Shoreline Highway.\nNearby residents need to recognize that their neighbor is a popular park established in 1908, long before the slopes of Tam were covered with houses.\nThe reasonable cap, one that recognizes Muir Woods' role as a park that's supposed to be forever accessible to a nation, will depend on the potential and actual effectiveness of the park service's traffic-relieving efforts.\nThe county Board of Supervisors, led by Supervisors Steve Kinsey and Kate Sears, has offered the park some possible solutions, starting points for coming up with long-needed solutions.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: In this IJ archive photo, visiters head toward the entrance of Muir Woods National Monument on Muir Woods Road near Mill Valley, Calif.

Once the glitz, glam, glitter and gluttony of the holidays are over, I crave simplicity. I long for austerity and to surround myself with natural neutrals. No frills, no excess. I want food no fancier than plain water and a tuna sandwich, and a home no fussier than a monastery.\nSo last week when a sea tide of photos featuring undyed natural linens in a beautifully simple home flowed into my inbox, it was an oasis for my overstimulated eyes. \nI had forgotten how much I loved linen, but Richard Ostell, a respected fashion and home designer, reminded me. The shots were from his home in Westchester, N.Y. Rough woven linens graced his tables, windows and bed like a pure sigh of relief.\nI wanted to crawl through my computer screen and into his home, make a cup of tea, sit by his window and decompress. Instead, I got him on the phone.\n\"I'm calling to talk about our mutual love of linen,\" I said, breaking Rule No. 1 in journalism: Be objective. Never show your bias.\n\"I'm not a fan of superfluous detail,\" he says, in a British accent that oozed refinement. \"I'd much rather have something plain. Linen is honest, simple, humble, durable and has an element of having been touched by human hands.\"\n\"I know!\" I blurt. \"And, I don't know about you, but after all the sequins of the holidays, I am so ready for linen. I mean, if I never see another mirrored ball!\" Then I smack myself. This reserved taste-leader, the former creative director for Liz Claiborne who now has his own furniture and product design company, would never have anything so gaudy as sequins in his home, let alone a mirrored ball.\nI really want to start the conversation over.\nOstell's work, whether in fashion or furnishings, reflects style that doesn't scream. His home whispers, \"I am here to comfort not impress.\" It's a mantra more homes should adopt.\n\"Linen is this great-looking fabric, so why don't we use it more?\" I continue, trying to recover whatever good opinion of me he might have had.\n\"I'm puzzled by that, as well,\" he says. \"Possibly because it's naturally rumpled look gave it a reputation for being too casual. It got pigeonholed, but it can be very sophisticated. I think a lot of people don't understand what they can do with it.\"\n\"I think it's the ironing,\" I say. \"All that pressing and starching. Who has time?\"\n\"I never iron linen,\" he says.\n\"Ever?\"\n\"It defeats the point of it. The rumpled look is part of its beauty. I love it right when it comes out of the dryer fluffy. I don't think people should think it looks messy. It should be left as it is.\"\n\"Maybe that rough and tumble look is okay for beds, but what about linen clothes?\"\n\"Wear your linen pants right off the line,\" Ostell said. (How quaint, a line.) \"And appreciate the fabric's natural state. Linen wrinkles. Pressed linen looks worse when it wrinkles. You don't want your linen to be pristine and pressed and perfect.\"\n\"I don't?\"\nI let this sink in: I can get a better look with less effort. I hang up, in love with linen even more than before.\nBesides permission to let my linen be rumpled, here are some other insights Ostell shared on how to live more beautifully with linen.\n*\nBest places. Ostell uses linen for bedding; his duvet cover is a natural linen color, undyed and unbleached, and his linen sheets and pillowcases are white. He uses heavy linen for drapes and upholstery, including slipcovers, and lighter-weight linen for tablecloths and napkins. \"You can over do it, but most people don't use linen enough.\"\n*\nKeep it natural. Though he's drawn to undyed linen, colored linen is okay if the color is achieved through a natural dye, he said. The only linen color he's opposed to is black. \"It doesn't fade well.\"\n*\nAlways at home. Pure natural linen mixes well with wood, metal, other fabrics, and all d\u00c8cor styles, said Ostell, from contemporary to rustic. It has a place in every style home, and keeps interiors from looking too cold.\n*\nThe class factor. Cotton and linen come from two different plants: cotton and flax. Hundreds of years ago, linen was valued over cotton for its stamina, sheen and feel, but as cotton became cheaper to mass produce, linen became considered a high-maintenance (when starched and ironed) symbol of class and status. Cotton is still usually less expensive. Cotton linen is a blend, and costs less than 100 percent linen. But fabric connoisseurs prefer pure linen, which gives a more uneven thread.\n*\nA test for best. When choosing, look for Irish or Belgian linen, the two best linens in the world, says Ostell. Linen from China is often not as good, wrinkles more easily, and is thin.\n*\nResist ironing. When you buy linen in the store, it is starched, pressed and finished very highly, he says. \"When you wash and dry it, it won't look that way anymore. And that's good. Leave it.\"\nLife, like linen, is better relaxed.\nSyndicated columnist Marni Jameson is the author of \"House of Havoc\" and \"The House Always Wins\" (Da Capo Press).

The rush and anticipation of the holidays are behind us, and we're left to wait for the freshness and surprises of spring.\nWhat are the best ways to make good use of this time at home or in the garden? Here are some of my favorite indoor tips followed by easy inspirational ideas from two design professionals in Marin. Next week, there will be tips for the garden.\n* If you haven't packed away the Christmas tree ornaments yet, go through them now and consolidate. Keep the ones you love and pass on to someone else the ones that you haven't used in a few years. \n* Have boxes of loose photos, closets of clothing, cabinets of dishes, a potting shed or the garage that need to be sorted out? Ask some friends or family members to help you organize them into piles you'll keep, give away or think about for another year. Serve an easy lunch of hot soup and French bread and promise to return the favor of helping out.\n* Hire a tree trimmer to get rid of all those dead, diseased and crossing branches. Open up the canopy for good tree health and to showcase the structure. You can admire the improvement from inside without lifting a finger.\n* Clean your windows, glass doors and mirrors, at least the ones you pass by most often. A little effort to make them sparkle makes a big difference.\n* Edit your collection of clippings and magazines. Do the same with file folders both on your computer and in your home office.\n* Discard home or garden items that are broken beyond repair. If it's reparable and you can use it, get it fixed soon.\n* For luxury you'll enjoy every day, buy fresh sheets and towels.\n* Look up and check your light bulbs. Replace burnt out ones with bright new ones and revel in the brightness.\n* Bring in foliage   spiky evergreens, shiny magnolias, blooming quince or birds of paradise blooms   from the garden and put them in every room of the house, even the ones you don't use often.\n* Plan now for a springtime party. Choose the theme, the menu, the guest list, the decorations, and start on the invitations.\nInterior designer Kress Jack of Kress Jack at Home in Mill Valley also has some tips for making good use of February. Her suggestions include:\n* Change out or move art around. Add pieces with vibrant colors like purples and pinks to wake up a hibernating house. Collect all of your small mirrors and create a new art installation to reflect light around the house and brighten up these short days.\n* Re-style your coffee tables. Add fun objects that remind you of vacations or time spent with people you love.\n* Paint an accent wall. \"I especially love to do this in a dining room where you can easily create a new vibe because it tends to be a delineated space. Then swap out napkins, candles and a centerpiece to complete the look. Try Galapagos Turquoise (Benjamin Moore No. 2057-20) for a real dramatic effect.\"\nWhen it comes to freshening up the home in February, interior designer Beryn Hammil of Beryn Hammil Designs in Corte Madera also has a few suggestions:\n* Throw pillows are this designer's best \"quick change\" trick. \"In the winter I use more textural, jewel-toned fabrics, and then swap them out for softer colors and fabrics for spring and summer. Each type complements the color scheme of the rooms.\n* Place flower arrangements throughout the house, both fresh cut and high-quality silk. \"My choice of colors and stems reflects the changing seasons.\"\n* Introduce a fresh fragrance. \"Taking my cue from Mother Nature, fragrance is the most subtle but potent way to signal a change in season, so my best secret is that in addition to changing the flowers, I change the fragrances in the diffusers and scented candles that I've placed in each room; holiday, fir and cinnamon type aromas for winter and then I change them to more floral scents for spring.\"\n* Open an inspirational book. \"To keep me company in the early evenings of winter, I read gardening books that inspire me for when nature beckons me back to work in my garden in early spring.\"\nPJ Bremier writes on home, garden, design and entertaining topics every Saturday and also on her blog atDesignSwirl.net .

Jerry Brown, on Friday, declared a state of emergency as the state faces a severe drought. \nAfter months without significant rain and reservoir levels dropping, few should be surprised by those pronouncements. But the public is waiting to find out what local water agencies plan to do about it.\nWater is a big issue in Marin. The issue of Marin having enough water to endure a prolonged drought has been on the ballot many times over the past 40-50 years. The latest was MMWD's controversial plan to build a desalination plant, which voters endorsed, but district directors shelved.\nBefore that, MMWD voters approved plans to expand the pipeline from the Russian River. Despite voters' approval, that plan was scrapped as MMWD directors changed course and opted to pursue desalination, which was tabled because conservation measures reduced the need for increasing sources of water.\nAfter going through a year that generated a record low in rainfall, we've seen little precipitation to start off 2014, and there are calls for moratoriums on new hookups and rationing.\nCounty supervisors want to know what actions local water agencies are planning to take. They have asked officials to attend the board's Jan. 28 meeting and give presentations on local water supplies and timelines for taking drought-related actions.\nMMWD recorded 10.68 inches of rain during 2013. The average is 52 inches. The district's reservoirs are at 55 percent of capacity, though they are usually at 77 percent this time of year.\nIn the North Marin Water District, the agency has recorded just 2 inches of rain this season. That's far less than the 16.7 inches recorded last winter and a drop in the bucket compared to the district's average of 27.2 inches.\nSupervisors are absolutely right to want to know what's going to happen, what actions are planned.\nLate last year, North Bay water districts warned of possible drought conditions and urged ratepayers to voluntarily reduce water usage by 20 percent. That has helped, but most observers   including veterans of Marin's 1976-77 drought   expect that rationing is around the corner.\nMMWD officials, while encouraging ratepayers to conserve, are holding off taking action until April.\nWhile we are all in this quandary together, in weighing possible rationing policies, mandatory cutbacks should respect those households and businesses that already are doing their part by conserving below-average usage.\nThere's no question that it is time conserve where we can.\nWhile the mild weather has been wonderful, it also has been worrisome. At this point, prospects of a return to normal rainfall seem iffy and we are headed into spring and summer, when water use rises. There is a feeling of uneasiness and apprehension as local water officials face a serious challenge.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: A tire lies exposed on dried mud by Stafford Lake in Novato, Calif. on Thursday, Jan. 9, 2014.

Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency Friday in California.\nBrown's declaration sets in motion a series of water conservation moves involving state water works, imposes water use reductions at state facilities and launches a publicity campaign promoting conservation that asks residents to reduce water use by 20 percent.\nThe drought declaration streamlines the rules for water agencies to transfer extra water from one part of the state to another, easing shortages. It also directs the state to hire more seasonal firefighters, limits the landscaping of highways and raises public awareness.\nThe biggest impact of the governor's crisis posture Friday may be in its public relations and educational value as residents across the state begin to take the water shortage seriously. \n\"You have to start talking about an issue at the top before people believe it is an issue,\" said Dietrich Stroeh of Novato, who as manager of the Marin Municipal Water District lead the county through the drought of 1974-77. \"When the leader says it's a problem, public awareness of conservation really gets going,\" he said. \"Everyone, every water agency, needs to look at their own situation,\" Stroeh said, adding that answers to the big question are needed. \"What happens if we don't get the rain?\"\nBefore three dry years ended with a gush of 67 inches of rain in the winter of 1977-78, Marin residents faced rationing of 37 gallons a day per person, with supplies piped in from the East Bay through an emergency conduit on the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge.\n\"We wrote the book on rationing programs,\" Stroeh said.\nA state resources agency study of Marin's experience noted residents came up with creative ways to conserve, made \"great sacrifices in convenience and comfort\" and slashed water use by 63 percent during 1976-77 \"when the reality of severe water shortage (was) impressed upon them.\" Part of that impression was made by Gov. Brown during his first term when he appeared at a Marin Civic Center press conference in 1977 to talk about drought woes.\nSupervisor Katie Rice, agreeing that public education and awareness is the most important result of Gov. Brown's latest drought declaration, saluted the call to arms. \"We can never be too early to conserve,\" she said.\nThat's a lesson that Supervisor Rice may have learned from her mother, Pamela Lloyd, a Marin water district director during the drought 37 years ago who appeared before state water officials in July 1977 to report on the lingering crisis. \"It has become abundantly clear that the uncertainty of near future weather (and) water supply conditions require now the most provident use and equitable allocation of available supplies and the most conservative, flexible and cooperative planning posture possible,\" Lloyd told state officials.\nAlthough California has a Mediterranean climate and periodically experiences drought, current conditions are particularly dry.\nThe Sierra Nevada snowpack on Thursday was 17 percent of normal. And last year, most cities in the state received the lowest amount of rain in any living Californian's lifetime. The rainfall records go back to 1850.\nFor the past 13 months, a huge high-pressure ridge in the atmosphere has sat off the West Coast, diverting storms that normally would bring winter rain northward to Canada.\nAs a result, reservoir levels are low, farmers and ranchers are suffering, and fire danger is at an extreme level.\nA number of county agencies already have taken action to curb water use, including city and county fire officials who on Thursday agreed to limit use of water during training drills.\nCounty Fire Chief Jason Weber has ordered a 25 percent reduction in water use at fire stations, shut down landscape irrigation systems and, for the first time during winter months, hired 14 seasonal firefighters to augment the troops, citing dry weather and high fire danger.\n\"The fire service is prepared and engaged,\" the chief said.\nMike Norton, building and maintenance manager at the Civic Center, said officials have taken a number of water conservation steps. \"We have either low-flow flush or waterless urinals and toilets\" and \"we're already on reclaimed water outside the building,\" he added. Cooling towers on the east side of the building could be shut down to save 500 gallons of water per hour, but doing so would heat up the building as much as 15 degrees. \"We could do that if it's necessary,\" he said.\nAgricultural Commissioner Stacy Carlsen said no one needs to tell Marin farmers there's a drought emergency. The drought has killed \"95 percent of the pasture in West Marin,\" and farmers are buying water from the National Park Service to fill their ponds, he said.\nCarlsen, holding out hope for federal drought aid, dispatched a letter Friday to the U.S. Department of Agriculture outlining the grim situation. \"The drought situation has spiraled down to unsurpassed levels,\" Carlsen's letter reported. \"2013 saw the lowest levels of rainfall in recorded history ... Marin Municipal Water District's official gauge at Lake Lagunitas recorded 10.68 inches while the annual average is 52 inches per year.\"\nMarin Municipal water officials have already taken steps to prepare for the worst. The district has asked customers to conserve, is shifting a reserve supply from Phoenix Lake, will activate reserve supplies at Soulajule reservoir, and is maximizing use of Lake Nicasio. On average, district reservoirs are at 77 percent capacity at this time of year, but now stand at only 55 percent.\nIn the North Marin Water District, manager Chris DeGabriele has issued a newsletter asking residents to conserve water and take steps including fixing leaky pipes and shutting down landscape irrigation. The district gets most of its water from the Russian River.\nSupervisor Steve Kinsey several months ago asked the county's eight water agencies to get together and report back on the drought and what they are doing to cope. That informational session is scheduled Jan. 28 at the Civic Center.\nKate Sears, president of the county board, applauded the gubernatorial declaration of a water emergency, saying a 20 percent conservation cutback makes sense.\n\"We are all in this together,\" Sears said.\nCalifornia normally receives nearly all its annual rainfall during the winter. However, time is running out on this winter.\nOn Thursday, the drought outlook worsened, as the U.S. Drought Monitor, a weekly update of drought conditions by federal agencies and researchers at the University of Nebraska, classified large sections of Northern California, including the Bay Area, as the fourth most severe of five drought categories: \"extreme drought.\"\nThe update showed that 63 percent of California's land is at that level of drought now, including the Bay Area, up from 27 percent the week before. Worse, scientists at the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center in Maryland issued a 90-day precipitation outlook that said it is likely that California will continue to receive below-normal rainfall at least through April.\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

Drake countered with a balanced attack as seven different players scored buckets in the first quarter.\nDrake started to pull away in the second period by attacking the boards with vigor, Jasper Verduin got busy with five rebounds, two on the offensive end, and the Pirates led by as many as nine points before intermission when Malik Huff scored a flying layup off a Hunt lob pass.\nMC battled back in the third period when Duysen knocked down a 3-pointer late in the quarter and pulled to within four points early in the fourth stanza on Joey Calcaterra's driving lay-up.\nFrom that point on, however, Drake seized control. The Pirates' defense forced a couple of turnovers on key MC possessions and Hunt worked hard in the paint to frequently march to the line where he deposited 9 of 10 free throws in the fourth quarter.\n\"There are basketball plays and there are smart basketball plays,\" MC coach Mike Saia said. \"We made some basketball plays tonight. We have some things to work on. But it's only the middle of January and we hopefully we're still into it in the middle of March.\"\nVerduin added eight points and team-high nine rebounds for the Pirates and Huff added six points, Miles Phillips came off the bench and scored two field goals to give Drake a lift when it was struggling at the offensive end in the third period.\nAlong with Duysen's 16 points, teammate Frankie Calacaterra also chipped in with 16. No other MC player had more than four points.\nContact Tim Menicutch via email atsports@marinij.com\nDRAKE 52, MARIN CATHOLIC 39\nMCAL\nMarin Catholic 14 7 11 7   39\nDrake 14 14 10 18   52\nMarin Catholic F.

It's basically over,\" said Patti Cohn, an agent with Pacific Union. \nThe numbers seem to bear her out. Foreclosure filings in Marin have declined steadily since 2010 and the market turned up sharply in 2012. RealtyTrac reported 1,979 foreclosure filings in 2012, 1,698 in 2011, 1,303 in 2012 and 515 in 2013.\n\"We had so many foreclosures and short sales in that one period of time in December 2010 and 2011,\" said Nancie Bottmeyer, a broker with the Madison Co., the Marin real estate brokerage she founded 35 years ago. A short sale is when a house is sold for less than what is owed on the mortgage.\nThe real estate crash and the accompanying foreclosures were a rude shock to homeowners and real estate professionals as well in a county known for its relentless prosperity and stratospheric property values.\n\"There's a business cycle and it goes up and down. In 1982 interest rates hit 14 to 16 percent. We took a hit then. But we didn't have foreclosures and short sales. That was something that was not in our vocabulary,\" Bottmeyer said.\n\"'Short sale,' that was completely unheard of. What's that? I had only handled a few foreclosures (before the crash),\" Bottmeyer said.\n\"This (the crash) was the biggest dip we saw   we hadn't seen house prices decrease in Marin in the 45 years the multiple listing service has been tracking numbers,\" said Bob Ravasio, a Coldwell Banker agent.\n\"The average annual sales price consistently increased in 40 years, wavering only a little,\" Ravasio said, citing statistics from Bay Area Real Estate Information Services, a multiple listing service. \"The market only decreased in 1990 and 1991 and it only went down about 3 percent. Then it continued its upward march.\n\"In the 2009 recession we went down as much as 20-25 percent. In some areas of Marin it fell 40 percent. You had this huge drop-off, it was really unprecedented. Now what we're seeing is a really strong comeback,\" Ravasio said.\nHome prices zoomed in 2013, jumping as much as 26 percent in one month year-over-year, and sales soared as well. As prices went up, it became possible for homeowners in financial straits to sell their homes for as much as was owed or more, alleviating foreclosures and short sales.\nThe newfound prosperity was not confined to Marin. Foreclosures fell and prices went up across the Bay Area as business boomed at Google, Facebook and other high-tech employers in Silicon Valley and, to a lesser extent, San Francisco.\nForeclosure filings were down 63 percent in Santa Clara County, home of Silicon Valley, in 2013; 69 percent in San Francisco County; 58 percent in Contra Costa County; and 63 percent in Alameda County, according to RealtyTrac.\nWhile the foreclosure crisis is coming to a close, the 515 filings in Marin indicate that it is not yet completely over, as Bottmeyer could attest.\n\"We're down to some of the last remnants of the foreclosures and short sales,\" the agent said. \"Those that are still lingering are usually tied up in the bank process. We had one in Pacheco Valle in Novato.\n\"It was extraordinary for sure. It was a short sale where the owner unexpectedly died and it had to go to probate court. We were in escrow on that for over a year and finally the buyers gave up. It started in December 2011 and went all the way through 2012,\" Bottmeyer said.\nThe good news: \"There aren't that many of those left,\" the agent said. \"It changed in December 2011. It was amazing how quickly it changed.\"\nRavasio said, \"As quickly as the bottom fell out in 2009, we have seen a snapback in the other direction. Buyers always are leading the market. They went away in 2009 and now they have come back strong.\"\nContact Janis Mara via email atjmara@marinij.com .

And some of them even talk. It's little wonder that companion birds are growing in popularity.\nAccording to a Pet Products Manufacturers Association survey, bird guardianship has been on the rise since 2010. Birds can now be found in more than 5 percent of homes, making them the nation's fourth most popular pet behind cats, dogs and fish. \nAt the same time, many companion birds wind up homeless when their guardians no longer want them or are unable to care for them properly. For more than a decade, animal shelters and bird rescue organizations across the country have recognized January as Adopt a Rescued Bird Month in an effort to find homes for the thousands of pet birds that are abandoned each year.\nCompanion birds can make wonderful pets for those who take the time to learn what bird care entails. No matter the species, birds need a well-constructed cage that's large enough for them to stretch their wings and fly short distances. Time spent outside of the cage in a safe, enclosed room is essential for most birds, while smaller species like finches and canaries should have proper environmental stimulation in their cages. Diet should consist of high-quality, organic pellets and fresh vegetables and fruits. Though tame, some birds like parrots still display wild behaviors, like screaming and pulling out feathers that can catch unsuspecting bird guardians by surprise.\nAdopting a bird is a long-term commitment. Most birds live eight years or longer, and a parrot's life span can be 60 to 80 years. Scheduling a visit to a board-certified, avian veterinarian at least once a year is essential, especially since birds are notorious for masking their symptoms when they are sick.\nGeorge, a stray parakeet found in Corte Madera, was brought to the Marin Humane Society by a good samaritan after flying into a window. Parakeets Albert, Chloe, Jazzie, Petie and Sienna were dumped at our shelter entrance. After Magic Man the pigeon was rescued from a gas station in Fairfax, its guardian declined to take it back.\nAll are available for adoption at MHS; find out more about them on our website, or by visiting our adoption center. For more information, consider registering for our upcoming bird basics workshop. Presented by local bird rescue organization Mickaboo Companion Bird Rescue, this free workshop will cover proper bird care and diet, symptoms of illness, general husbandry, taming and training, and all the basics you need to determine if adopting a companion bird is right for you.\nCarrie Harrington is the director of communications at the Marin Humane Society, which contributes Tails of Marin articles.

But now the state is seeking longer leases for such operations and after it develops criteria, will ask companies to bid for the ferry contract to provide the service.\nThat means the McDonoghs could lose the contract. That has angered locals who believe the state is intent on giving the family the boot so it can get someone in who would pay more to the parks to provide the service.\nNot so, said Danita Rodriguez, superintendent of Marin's state parks.\n\"Maggie has done a great job, but the state is updating all its contracts,\" she said.\nCapt. Maggie McDonogh is the current operator of the service, which takes between 55,000 and 70,000 people to Angel Island annually. The boat launches from the tip of Tiburon, near downtown.\n\"It sometimes feels like they are after us, but I really just think they are doing their job,\" McDonogh said of state officials.\nMore than 100 people came out to support McDonogh at a public hearing at the Mill Valley Community Center Thursday night. Some wore paper hats inscribed with words in support of the current ownership.\nState officials hoped to have people go to various tables at the center to give comments after an initial introduction. But the crowd grew angry at the proposal and after huddling, state officials decided to change the format and allow comments to be taken from the floor so they could be heard by everyone.\nThe state is looking to award a contract of 10 years. Developing criteria for what is sought in an operator will take between four and six months. Bids will likely be solicited by the end of the year with an operator selected in early 2015. McDonogh's experience in running the service will give her preference over competitors, state officials said.\nAll who spoke were in favor of McDonogh keeping the service and specifically cited her ferrying more than 1,200 firefighters to fight a fire on Angel Island in 2008.\n\"I was overwhelmed,\" McDonogh said of the support. \"It was touching and truly amazing.\"\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\n -\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: In this IJ archive photo, an Angel Island Ferry takes off from Tiburon, Calif. on one of it's daily runs to Angel Island on May 5, 2003.

In a phone conversation during his day off Tuesday, the former all-ACC honorable mention from Duke said he had a good idea which 49ers player he might be assigned. \n\"Anquan Boldin   that's who I was before the last two times we played,\" said the 24-year-old Helfet, who isn't eligible to play in the game (barring an unexpected injury to one of the active players before Sunday), but will be on the sideline.\n\"Last time, I was Boldin against (Seahawks defensive back Richard Sherman) all week. (Sherman) told me I gave him better moves.\"\nBefore the Seahawks' victory over the New Orleans Saints last weekend, Helfet mimed dangerous tight end Jimmy Graham during practice. The Seahawks limited Graham to one catch for 8 yards.\n\"When I see our defense anticipate a move and make a great play, I feel like I did my job,\" said Helfet, who had five catches for 79 yards during exhibition games before the season.\nHelfet said not getting to play in a regular-season game has been frustrating, but he believes the experience will pay off down the road.\n\"I still learn new things every day. I stay ready because I could get the call at any time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching a ton of film on some of the best receivers in the league. It's a great education.\"\nSeattle tight end Luke Willson went down with what looked like a serious leg injury during the final game of the regular season. Helfet was on high alert heading into Seattle's playoff opener last week, but Willson's injury was diagnosed as a high ankle sprain and the 2007 all-MCAL lacrosse player of the year was relegated back to the bench.\n\"They were saying, 'Get ready to play,'\" Helfet said. \"Luckily   well, somewhat luckily   he was able to make it back and play. \"... (The tight ends) are a close-knit group. Zach Miller, Luke and Kellen Davis, we stick together.\"\nAs the only two players from the Bay Area, Helfet and running back Marshawn Lynch (a standout at Oakland Tech and Cal) have developed a strong bond. Offensive lineman Breno Giacomini is another friend.\n\"All the guys are good guys. Even the ones who have that reputation of being a certain way on the field. Those guys are great too,\" said Helfet, referring to opinions expressed by 49ers fans about the hard-hitting, loud-talking Seahawks defense.\n\"That's the thing about this organization. I've met great people from the front office all the way through.\"\nHelfet has family and friends on his pass list for Sunday's game against a 49ers team beloved in Marin County. He knows many have dual loyalties, but he has one rule.\n\"No 49ers red and gold in the Seahawks family section,\" Helfet said. \"We text about (the rivalry) all the time. I know they are all Niners fans. \"... I sure was.\"\nContact Dave Allen via email at dallen@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Seattle Seahawks' Cooper Helfet dives across the goal line to score against the Oakland Raiders in the second half of a preseason NFL football game Thursday, Aug. 30, 2012 in Seattle.

And in those 164 years, its upper school has only been for girls.\nUntil now.\nThe private school's board of 20 directors unanimously voted Friday to begin admitting boys to the high school for the fall of 2015, a decision made in light of declining demand for single-gender schools.\n\"The potential of extending co-education has been discussed several times over the last 10, 20 years,\" Head of School Cecily Stock said. \"This year our board decided the time was right to take that next step.\" \nSan Domenico, the state's oldest Catholic school, is Marin County's only school with students from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade. It began admitting boys for pre-kindergarten and kindergarten in 1973, and eventually opened enrollment to boys in the school's elementary and middle schools.\nBoard president Glenn Snyder said the decision was made to boost the high school's enrollment   and sustain the school long-term.\n\"Between the market changing, and looking for the right thing for the school so it can really thrive,\" Snyder said, \"we wanted to capture on the demand and the interest that is inherent in our pre-K-8 program.\"\nThough overall enrollment has remained steady, the high school enrollment has declined over the years. When the school moved to the San Anselmo location nearly 50 years ago, it had about 300 students. This year, enrollment is around 170.\nSan Domenico's county use plan caps total attendance at 680. So, as the high school student body increases, adjustments will have to be made elsewhere.\n\"What we would see happening is increasing our high school to about 300 to 320 students,\" Stock said, \"and our middle school, which is about 220 students, would gradually decrease.\"\nDemand for expensive private schools, particularly in a county with such reputable public schools, has also factored into the school's declining high school enrollment.\nThis year's high school tuition is $34,700 for San Domenico's day students and $51,000 for boarding students. Tuition for the lower grades ranges from $23,900 to $26,500. Pre-kindergarten costs $12,500.\nThe 515-acre campus is tucked away in San Anselmo's Sleepy Hollow area. The school has its own equestrian center, 2,358 solar panels and a badminton team.\nMore than half of the school's high school students live on campus, including 68 from other countries. Administrators said the international component to the student body is crucial to the San Domenico experience.\n\"It offers a diverse learning experience that (students) usually can't get without going on a semester abroad,\" Snyder said. \"It's such a global world these days, everybody needs that experience.\"\nThe school plans for its first co-ed high school class to have boarding and day students.\n\"There is significant interest outside of U.S. in the co-ed education,\" Snyder said.\nStock said that boys leaving San Domenico's middle school generally head off to any of 14 different high schools   public and private   in the area.\nMichele Huff, whose four daughters have attended or are attending San Domenico, said she is happy with the decision, though not all parents are on board.\n\"A lot of the parents of the girls in the high school are opposed,\" Huff said. \"That makes sense, because they are invested in an all-girls education. For some girls, it is a really beneficial thing.\"\nAdministrators said that while there is some opposition to the switch, they found the San Domenico community to be generally supportive of the move, particularly among parents of San Domenico's middle school boys.\n\"Those boys are looking to continue their San Domenico education\" in high school, Snyder said.\nSnyder said that while there are challenges with any change, he is confident the transition will go smoothly.\n\"Between the planning that we've done and the raw talent we have (on staff), we are fully prepared,\" Snyder said.\nContact Laith Agha via email at lagha@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: San Domenico high school students walk from class to the cafeteria on campus in San Anselmo, Calif. on Friday, Jan. 17, 2014.

After declaring a moratorium on new building in the Redwood Corridor, the council embarked on a methodical and open process that has led to new guidelines for the 30-acre swath of downtown. \nIt was not an endless building ban, but a municipal time-out to reach out to the community and draft a new plan for the area.\nFor several years, the city has eyed redevelopment of this area as a potential steady source of income. Its vision has been transforming the acreage, now host to mainly industrial uses, by turning it into a retail hub, similar to the Corte Madera Town Center or Berkeley's Fourth Street.\nThe guidelines seek to create a mix of retail, restaurants, jobs, affordable housing and an overall inviting community \"gathering place.\"\nThe guidelines tentatively adopted by the council are a further refinement of the city's 2010 plan for the area along the east side of Redwood Boulevard, between De Long Avenue and San Marin Drive, and the large undeveloped parcel on the west side of Redwood.\nCity officials had set a May 2014 moratorium deadline, but they were able to complete the planning work before then. That is what the city had promised. City planning director Bob Brown deserves credit for keeping this process on a tight schedule while also providing the public many opportunities to be heard.\nThe new plan isn't without controversy.\nThe council, in a straw vote on the guidelines, split 4-1.\nCouncilwoman Pat Eklund cast the lone dissenting vote.\nHer primary concern during the Jan. 7 council meeting was that the area not become \"another shopping center.\"\n\"I believe the people in this community do not want another shopping center,\" she said. \"To me, there's just too much retail in here.\"\nHer colleagues didn't veer from the city's long-held goal for the space, although they agreed to change some wording, from \"retail center\" to \"retail area.\" The proposed mix of uses also should help prevent this area from being \"another shopping center.\"\nThe general guidelines adopted by the council will be added to an update of the city's general plan. There will be a chance for even more public discussion and debate during that process.\nThe guidelines advanced by the council are important, however, because they provide the marketplace, City Hall and the public a community-based vision of the goals and needs Novato has in mind for the acreage.\nThis front-end consensus is supposed to make the approval process clearer and easier and the economic cost of the moratorium worth it.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Courtesy of City of Novato Three design schemes, including one highlighting the structural framework of focal-point building, have been presented for redeveloping the north Redwood corridor in Novato.

From smoke-free college campuses, outdoor cafes, bus stops, parks and beaches, to living spaces sharing walls, the Smoke-free Marin Coalition's partnership with local elected leaders has led to progressive protections for Marin residents where they live, work, learn and play.\nAll four of Marin's hospitals and the county Health and Human Services clinics have 100 percent smoke-free campuses. Their staff has received extensive training from the Marin Tobacco Related Disease Control Program to assist patients in quitting smoking. \nWorkers and visitors to Marin County can expect a clean, healthy environment, thanks to the pro-active courage of our elected officials working collaboratively with the coalition and Marin's Health and Human Services Department.\nA recent study published in Preventative Medicine shows that these types of smoke-free restrictions nearly double the odds of people smoking less while also protecting non-smokers.\nHowever, our work is not complete; there is much more to be accomplished.\nSome of our local communities have not updated their ordinances to keep up with the scientific findings about second- and third-hand smoke, particularly when it comes to protecting nonsmokers who share walls and common air spaces with smokers, risking both fires and lung damage.\nAnd there are still merchants who don't mind making a profit off neighborhood teens experimenting with tobacco. These careless merchants view the penalties of selling to youth as a business expense.\nA \"Tobacco Retailer License\" that gives communities the power to suspend licenses to sell tobacco to repeat violators would effectively solve this problem.\nOnly three jurisdictions in Marin have enacted such protections for the youth in their communities.\nThe most potent threat to progress are the new \"electronic nicotine delivery toys,\" also known as e-cigarettes, hookah or \"vaping kits\" and other devices. These products were banned in some other countries as unsafe.\nTheir marketers confuse young people (and others) into believing that they are healthy alternatives to tobacco. E-cigarettes look so much like cigarettes that they make smoking seem cool and socially acceptable again, potentially reversing decades of progress.\nThey also delay quit attempts, sustaining eternal addiction to nicotine, resulting in lives cut short after painful diseases, taking a toll on Marin families.\nNot surprisingly, the tobacco companies have purchased many of the e-cigarette companies. The \"wolf in sheep's clothing\" is back again. This is not good for our public health.\nThe Smoke-Free Marin Coalition, now in its 23rd year, is launching a multiple-year public health campaign to help Marin consumers make educated choices about whether to use these toxic products.\nThe county's Tobacco Control Program just initiated a new 10-year project, joining forces with Alcohol Control and Nutrition advocacy groups to promote a program called \"Healthy Retail Environments\" so that our local neighborhood stores offer healthier choices; this will include tobacco-free pharmacies.\nIn addition to helping current smokers quit, enforcing current policies, and protecting youth from slavery to life-long tobacco addiction, the coalition will keep up its campaign to encourage the county's pension board from investing in stocks that support addiction, disease and early death.\nTo learn more about the risks of e-cigarettes and the Smoke-Free Marin Coalition's upcoming plans, visit: www.smokefreemarin.com .\nJennie Cook of Larkspur is chair of the Smoke-Free Marin Coalition.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Jennie Cook stands in front of an apartment complex on Thursday, Mar. 21, 2013, in Larkspur, Calif.

John Surinchak think term limits are a good way to refresh the Marin County Board of Supervisors, and both signed a petition to do just that.\nThe two Marin religious leaders were among several dozen people who joined an effort to limit county board members to 12 years in office as Marin Republican activists staffed a campaign booth at the farmers market at the Civic Center on Thursday.\nThomas Montgomery of San Rafael, vice chairman of the Marin Republican Central Committee and head of the petition drive, and Morgan Kelley, past GOP committee chairman, reported a brisk business, with 35 people signed up by 10:30 a.m., even though most people passing the booth at mid-morning did not stop. \nMontgomery insisted the effort was a nonpartisan affair to end an \"entrenched incumbency\" in which financial backers keep favored politicians in business. The five Marin supervisors are registered Democrats.\nSupervisors have had little to say publicly about the term limit effort, although Judy Arnold said she \"always believed term limits are up to the voters in the ballot box.\" Term limits \"deny me the right to vote for whom I want,\" Sheriff Robert Doyle added the other day.\nThe term limit campaign has signed up about 1,000 people so far. Advocates must collect signatures of 11,418 registered voters over the next five months to force a November 2014 ballot measure.\nCivic Center officials should be able to take care of business in three four-year terms, Montgomery said. The petition sets three four-year terms as the limit for newly elected supervisors, who later this year may include Susan Adams and Arnold. Adams will face a challenge from San Rafael City Councilman Damon Connolly in June. Arnold will face a challenge from Democrat Toni Shroyer, a Novato realty agent who is among the leaders of the term-limit drive.\nSupervisors Katie Rice, Kate Sears and Steve Kinsey, now in the middle of four-year terms, would be limited to serve another two four-year terms if re-elected and if the term limit measure qualifies for the ballot and is endorsed by voters.\n\"If we can get the signatures, we can get it passed,\" Kelley said between efforts to wave passersby over to the booth in the market's \"free speech\" section. \"People are very upset with the county board,\" she said, citing a deluge of letters to the editor \"complaining about all sorts of things they do.\"\nBoth Rabbi Rice and Rev. Surinchak, who spread the word of the spiritual world from booths nearby, said they thought 12 years was a reasonable amount of time for a politician to get the job done.\n\"We need some flow,\" Rabbi Rice said, adding he was speaking as an individual and not as a representative of Chabad of Marin. \"Politics is something more people should be involved in ... Why would we want the same people in office for life?\"\nRev. Surinchak acknowledged \"a little hesitation in pushing people out of office just when they are starting to learn the job,\" but on reflection said 12 years was plenty of time. \"I like the idea of rotating people through these positions.\"\n\"I've never signed one of these before but I'm signing this!' one man told Kelley. Several others signing the petition declined to explain why. Those passing by expressed disinterest or no opinion at all. Several had just moved to Marin or lived outside the county.\nMichael Parsons of San Rafael, a retired water district employee, was among those who lingered. \"I think it's good, but I have to think about it,\" he said. \"There's a necessity for change, and I'll think about signing. I'll be back Sunday.\"\nMontgomery said activists will be back at the Sunday's farmers market, decked out in the free speech zone near the entrance, to collect more signatures.\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

Its analysis indicated that while 91 percent of white children attend preschool, only 32 percent of Latino kids attend. Other MarinKids findings: 30 percent of children from poor families score well in English, compared to 82 percent of others; 44 percent of black and 64 percent of Latino kids score adequately in fifth grade math, compared to 86 percent of white and 93 percent of Asian students; and Asian and white students have higher graduation rates in Marin than Latino and black students.\nThe commission told county supervisors this week that demand for child care far exceeds supply, with about 800 kids waiting for subsidized child care \"at any point in time.\" On Wednesday, 645 Marin kids were on the list, according to Aideen Gaidmore, executive director of Marin Child Care Council, a separate but allied advocacy group.\nChild care costs are high, and providers need training, assistance and related help as well, the commission reported.\nThe plan did not offer specific solutions, but noted the document can be used to engage stakeholders, provide a framework for planning and identify opportunities for improvements. The panel said the next step is development of a \"strategic action plan\" this spring.\nAlthough funding is central, no one mentioned an idea circulating among key advocates for children   the need for a local tax measure. Supervisor Katie Rice suggested public financing as a state solution.\n\"We've got a long way to go,\" Rice said. \"We are really, really behind here in California. It really needs public financing.\"\nAmy Reisch, executive director of First 5 Marin Children and Families Commission, an advocacy panel funded by tobacco tax revenue, said the child care commission report comes as no surprise   and added a tax plan is in the works. A coalition of advocacy groups is working on a ballot issue to raise sales taxes to pay for programs benefiting children, she said.\n\"Kids are as much a part of our infrastructure as roads or bridges,\" Reisch observed. \"What we are seeing is that there are huge disparities in Marin ... It all comes back to the disparity of poverty.\"\nFollowing the commission presentation, Supervisor Judy Arnold said that quality child care \"has to be coupled with universal preschool.\"\nSupervisor Steve Kinsey called quality child care a \"fundamental part of a healthy community\" and a \"core value,\" an issue that can rally people of diverse political persuasions.\n\"It's a great investment in downstream prevention,\" Kinsey noted.\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

Marin County ranked 14th in average retirement and health costs with $22,338 per employee and 20th in total retirement and health costs with $58.9 million for the year.\nWith average retirement and health costs per employee of $29,783, the city of San Rafael ranked 20th among 479 California cities. \nController John Chiang created his public employee compensation website to promote government transparency in the wake of the 2010 salary scandal in the city of Bell.

I think there is an intent to put more every year into that trust fund.\"\nMichael Lotito of San Rafael, another member of Citizens for Sustainable Pension Plans, said, \"The fact that Marin County is 20th means that it is in better shape than many, but the fact is that with few exceptions probably none of them are in good shape.\"\nJeff Wickman, Marin County's Retirement Administrator, said, \"Retirement benefits are based on pensionable wages so if the wages are higher then you're going to see the potential for higher pension benefits also.\"\nResponding to San Rafael's relatively high average retirement and health cost number, City Manager Nancy Mackle said, \"We have made a lot of changes to our retiree health.

I have no words to thank them.\" \nThe music program started in 2007 when Jane Kramer, of Larkspur, bought 15 recorders with her own money and began teaching music to low-income Canal area children. Armed with grant-writing skills and supportive parents, she's grown the free music program to include more than 120 youths, multiple music teachers and a wide variety of instruments.\nKramer modeled the program after the experiences she had as a child at the Fine Arts Music Conservatory of Miami, a community music school. Two years into running her program, she learned of the El Sistema music program in Venezuela and was stunned by the similarities.\n\"Everything I was doing was completely in concert with El Sistema. It was what I was doing in the Canal,\" Kramer said.\nThe Enriching Lives through Music program is now an affiliate of El Sistema through the National Alliance of El Sistema Inspired Programs. The El Sistema program started 38 years ago in a parking garage in Caracas when a teacher gathered 11 children together to play music. The program's curriculum is now taught to more than 500,000 low-income Venezuelan children.\nTwo of Kramer's music students have been chosen to participate in the prestigious Take a Stand Symposium next month in Los Angeles to be trained as student leaders in the El Sistema music program. Davidson Middle School students Diana Luarca, 13, and Jocelyn Chacon, 13, are two of the 25 students who have been selected from across the country to participate and receive $1,000 scholarships to attend.\nDiana, who primarily plays violin, said she's excited about attending the conference.\n\"We're going to learn leadership skills and how to work well with other people from other communities by playing together as a group,\" she said. \"I'm hoping to help out in (the Enriching Lives program) when I get older and get into high school and be one of their interns.\"\nThe viola-playing Jocelyn said she was surprised she and Diana were selected for the honor.\n\"I was telling all my friends when I got accepted,\" Jocelyn said. \"I'm kind of nervous about meeting all the people.\"\nKramer also plans to attend the conference, which will focus on empowering students to step into leadership roles and teach them the power of ensemble music. One of the main goals of the El Sistema program is to change the trajectory of people's lives through orchestra involvement, peer-teaching and community building.\n\"It's been a really wonderful thing for us that we're now part of it,\" Kramer said. \"Our mission is to help kids succeed in all facets of their lives.\"\nIn the Canal, music program participants are taught after school at the Albert J. Boro Community Center, the Canal Alliance and San Pedro Elementary School. On Saturdays, children meet at Bahia Vista Elementary School to play music for three hours.\nAll students start on the soprano recorder, chorus and Orff mallet instruments to learn basic music skills. They are then given the opportunity to choose a different instrument, such as the violin, flute, viola or clarinet to master. Chamber ensembles, an orchestra, concerts with renowned musicians and guest artist visits are some of the program's other perks.\nJocelyn, who fell in love with the viola's lower tones after playing the violin, said she and her parents enjoy being part of the program.\n\"My friends are there and I get to learn new things. They take their time and meet with people individually if they're having problems and it feels like it's one-on-one,\" she said.\nFor Diana, the experience has opened up opportunities for her to succeed. She plans to go to college to become a music teacher or geologist.\n\"Everyone is really nice and everyone who is in the program has helped me do a lot,\" Diana said. \"I've gone to many places and if it weren't for them I wouldn't be going on the (conference) trip.\"\nBefore heading off to Los Angeles, Diana, Jocelyn and the other students will perform at a concert at 2 p.m. Feb. 8 at the Albert J. Boro Community Center at 50 Canal St. in San Rafael. Kramer said the free concert, featuring both Beethoven and Latin music, will be followed by a potluck.\nThe music program is in the process of becoming a nonprofit organization and Kramer said she spends her free time writing grant applications to keep money in the coffers. While the parents help by hosting fundraisers, supervising the children and supporting the youths, money is still needed to provide the free instruments and lessons. Especially since Kramer plans to start a new cello program soon.\nShe said the program is worth donating to because it fosters self esteem, resilience and gives the Spanish-speaking parents an opportunity to relate to their children in a way that is difficult to do in the dominantly English-only school systems.\n\"It's not about only the music, it's about creating community through ensemble,\" Kramer said.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

Councilwoman Renee Goddard requested that the decision be referred to the council for a fresh appraisal.\nOpponents, who said the station would tarnish Fairfax's charm and threaten two independent gas stations, made skillful use of social media to rally supporters to their cause. They created a \"No Chevron in Fairfax\" group on Facebook and posted a petition opposing the station onChange.org ., which has garnered more than 600 signatures. More than 150 opponents turned out for a public hearing on the station in December, and Wednesday night the council chambers was packed again. \n\"It sure felt like to those of us there that no reasonable-minded official could go against the will of the people,\" Richard Devereauz wrote on the opponents' Facebook page following the meeting.\nBut Fairfax Mayor David Weinsoff said the council's decision was more than just a reaction to popular sentiment.\n\"The fact that they turned out in significant numbers demonstrates once again the robust democracy that we enjoy in Fairfax,\" Weinsoff said. \"But I was not swayed at all by the fact that a great number of citizens showed up. It was what they said, not their mere appearance.\"\nThe proposed site for the station at 2001 Sir Francis Drake Blvd. served as a gas station from the 1960s until late 2008 or 2009. From the early 1970s to the mid 1990s, the site was the home of a Chevron station.\nMore than 70 tons of soil and 1,600 pounds of polluted groundwater were removed from the site after elevated levels of diesel, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes and methyl tertiary-butyl ether, known as MTBE, were found in soil samples in 1998. Cleanup of the site to state standards was completed this summer.\nArash Salkhi, the owner of the property, could not be reached for comment Thursday. Salkhi, who owns other Chevron stations, has previously stated his frustration that opposition to the project didn't develop until after it had been approved by the Planning Commission. Salkhi said the fervor of the opposition came as a \"rude awakening.\"\nOn Wednesday night, the Town Council directed town staff to draw up a resolution making its rejection of the proposal final, which it will vote on Feb. 5. Opponents, however, were celebrating victory Thursday.\nBranden Barber, one of the organizers of the opposition, who works for Amazon Watch, said, \"To me it seemed like the council was pretty united in not wanting to put this through.\"\nRoni Krouzman, another opposition organizer, said, \"I wasn't surprised, given the massive turnout and how flawed the application was. Part of the role of the public was to find the holes in the application and then bring them to light to the staff and Town Council.\"\nKrouzman said many of the people who got involved in this issue had never participated in local politics before. Krouzman said he has lived in Fairfax for nine years and the December public hearing on the Chevron station was the first time he had attended a council meeting. He said many others were also attending their first meeting.\nKrouzman said, \"One of the silver linings of this is that a lot of people feel more inspired to be involved in the future.\"\nContact Richard Halstead via e-mail atrhalstead@marinij.com", "author": "By Richard Halstead", "title": "Fairfax Town Council rejects Chevron plan"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Pro golfers and tennis players carve up multimillion dollar prize purses every week. Even utility major league baseball players sign seven-figure contracts. Yet professional runners in this country make do with free shoes and, occasionally, a race check just large enough to have a comma. Marin native Jake Schmitt, 26, has embarked on that hard road of post-collegiate distance running, and absolutely loves it.\nJake's dad, Tom, was an MCAL half-mile champion at Terra Linda High and his mom Laura (Starrett) graduated from Redwood with a school two-mile record that still stands 31 years later. Younger sisters Megan and Caitlin both ran for Redwood, with Megan later playing on the Cal volleyball team and Caitlin now racing for UCLA. \nAt Redwood, Jake amassed 12 MCAL and three North Coast Section titles in track and cross country and was a state Division III champion in the latter. He enrolled at Cal, where both parents had raced, but was not happy with the running program. After one year, he transferred to the University of Washington, where he earned All-American honors and notched best times of 13 minutes, 54 seconds for 5,000 meters and 28:53 in the 10,000.\nIt was then into the lonely void of American post-collegiate racing. Jake returned to live in the family home in Kentfield to train full-time. Brooks Shoes provided some sponsorship and he joined the Bay Area Track Club, coached by Olympic marathoner Magdalena Lewy-Boulet (wife of former Drake High distance star Richie Boulet). Olympic medalist Shannon Rowbury and World championship medalist Alysia Monta\u00d2o were training partners.\nBut again things weren't quite right.\n\"I just couldn't string together long periods of quality training,\" Schmitt said. \"I qualified for the 2012 Olympic Trials marathon by running 1:04:50 in the Giants Half Marathon but a hamstring injury kept me from participating. I was ready to race the Chicago Marathon but again didn't get to the starting line. I was having a hard time dedicating myself exclusively to running.\"\nSo after a try at culinary school, Jake took a job with Salesforce, a San Francisco-based cloud computing company and moved to the City. Laura, long-time head track and cross-country coach at Redwood, became his coach. The moves did wonders for his running.\n\"In January 2012, I really got serious about running again,\" Schmitt said. \"I entered my first race in two years, the Kaiser Half Marathon. Running purely on instinct, I was surprised with how strong I felt and won by more than a minute. I realized then that I could run and work.\"\n\"My goal for Jake is the same as for all my athletes; to love the sport, to get to the starting line prepared and with a smile, and to enjoy each race,\" Laura Schmitt said. \"Jake is learning to balance full-time work and training and to achieve those goals.\"\nJake now runs before and after work, through the Marina and the Presidio, at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Still, the 80 or so weekly miles are well down from his earlier 100-120 average. Once a week, Laura comes to Golden Gate Park to oversee a training session on the Kezar track.\nThis October, Jake made his delayed marathon debut, at Twin Cities in Minnesota, the 2012 national championship. He ran with the lead pack, clicking off sub-five minute miles, until a long incline slowed him during miles 21-23 and put him \"in the most pain of my life.\"\nBut he pushed through and finished strong, passing runners to place seventh. His 2:15:09 was fast enough to earn a place in the 2016 U.S. Olympic marathon trials.\n\"I knew I was finally back to racing at the highest level,\" Jake said. \"And it felt really great.\"\n\"I've had the privilege of watching Jake's running career since he was 12,\" San Anselmo coach Mike Fanelli said. \"I am delighted to see the quality young man he has morphed into ... great character, always positive and hugely generous putting back into the sport. A head-to-toe role model and one of Marin's greatest runners ever.\"\nJake now hopes to also qualify for the Olympic trials on the track at 5,000 and 10,000 meters. This fall, he plans on racing the Chicago Marathon and lowering his time into the 2:12 range. And he still finds time to assist Laura at Redwood, a job that brings joy and triumphs.\n\"Jake has changed who I am,\" Redwood's top distance runner Fred Huxham said. \"I would not have been successful   as an athlete, as a student and as a human being   without his help. He's irreplaceable.\"\nJake's long-term goal? \"To be running on Mt. Tam for the rest of my life.\"\nCouples Relay\nThe Couples Relay returns for a 34th edition on Feb. 9.

Getting people to include water-saving steps and measures in their lives is going to be important.\nLongtime Marin residents, veterans of the 1976-77 drought during which daily water use was restricted to 37 gallons per person, call it an \"ethic\" of water conservation. That ethic, or community focus, is needed to get through this emergency.\nMMWD, at one time, had talked about installing smart meters on homes and businesses to help ratepayers monitor their daily water use and to conserve. The local uproar over PG&E's installation of smart meters appeared to sidetrack that proposal.\nBut with electronic calculations, local water agencies should be able to track daily water use   or the success of conservation efforts   on a more frequent and helpful basis than waiting for monthly water bills or trying to figure out how to read the water meter.\nKinsey is correct; we are all in this together. Each of us has a responsibility to conserve water.\nMarin residents have done it before. It takes a community focus on an important goal   every single drop counts.\nSetting a goal, devoting efforts to promoting community awareness and providing the public with an easy way to track the success of our efforts could prove valuable in responding to this emergency   together.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Morning fog mists Nicasio Reservoir on Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2014, in Nicasio, Calif.

Neither Wade nor anyone else has been charged, and the case remains open.\nWade, who was sentenced last week for a gun ambush in Mill Valley and the theft of a $200,000 sports car in San Francisco, was moved from Marin County Jail to San Quentin on Thursday morning to begin his prison life.\nWade, 19, will spend about 90 days at San Quentin while prison authorities decide where he will serve the bulk of his sentence, said prison Lt. Sam Robinson. \nWade is being held in the highest security unit at the prison because of the notoriety of his case and a previous attempt by Wade's allies to break him out of juvenile hall, Robinson said.\nWade will have to serve about 16 years in prison before beginning a life sentence, at which point he can start applying for parole.\nWade's trial lawyer, Charles Dresow, said he is preparing an appeal.\nWade was convicted in October when a Marin County jury found him guilty of trying to murder Landon Wahlstrom, 18, in 2012. Wade, then 17 years old, rode a motorcycle up to Wahlstrom's truck in Mill Valley and repeatedly fired a gun into the cab.\nWahlstrom's girlfriend, 17-year-old Eva Dedier of Terra Linda, was also sitting in the truck, but the jury found insufficient evidence to prove Wade was trying to kill her as well.\nThe prosecution alleged that Wade launched the attack because he desired Dedier for himself and was jealous that Wahlstrom was dating her.\nThe jury also convicted Wade of stealing a $200,000 Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder from a San Francisco dealership in 2011. But they found insufficient evidence to prove that Wade was actually the burglar who broke into the dealership through an upper window and rappelled down to the car.\nMarin County sheriff's detectives found the Lamborghini and evidence linking Wade to both sets of crimes after tailing him to a storage locker in Richmond. Wade was arrested after trying to run from detectives and pulling a Glock handgun from his waistband.\nWade, who was charged as an adult, pleaded not guilty to the crimes and did not cooperate with authorities before the trial. However, a court probation report released this week shows that Wade made numerous admissions in a recent interview with Deputy Probation Officer My Tran.\nAccording to Tran's synopsis of the interview, Wade admitted to shooting at Wahlstrom's truck, but said he did not think the passenger was Eva Dedier. He said he thought the passenger was Wahlstrom's brother and initially changed his mind about shooting, but then fired five shots anyway.\n\"He did not intend to kill the victim,\" Tran wrote, summarizing Wade's comments. \"He stated that he has been involved with shooting guns since age six or seven. He would not have missed the victim if he did not change his mind.\"\nWade said \"he feels sorry for what he did to Eva and never would want to harm her,\" Tran said. \"He is sorry for doing this and for the disturbance that he caused in the neighborhood of the shooting.\"\nThe report also details the evidence found in the Richmond storage locker, including police uniforms, latex gloves, radio signal jammers, guns, ammunition, rapelling equipment, fake identification and plans to stage a jewelry store heist in San Francisco and escape by helicopter.\nIn addition, investigators found a sales contract indicating that Wade planned to sell the Lamborghini, which belonged to television chef Guy Fieri, for $201,500 by shipping it from the Port of Oakland to a dealership in the Dominican Republic.\nThe shipping contract carried the signature of Wade's alias, \"Carmine Leone Colombo,\" an apparent reference to the New York mob family.\nThe probation report also includes a detailed description of Wade's juvenile criminal history, which dates to September 2007, when Wade was 13. The record includes seven reports from the Tiburon Police Department and one from the former Twin Cities Police Department.\nThe allegations included setting off a \"stink/smoke\" bomb in a clothing store; spraying another child in the face with an unknown substance; posting images on his MySpace account of a BB gun, brass knuckles, a marijuana leaf and a Ku Klux Klan emblem; punching a girl classmate between her shoulder blades; stealing girls' journals and threatening to post them on the Internet; assaulting his mother; stealing his mother's truck; and hosting a large teen party at a Tiburon home while the actual residents were away on vacation.\nWade, who went to Del Mar Middle School in Tiburon and then attended Redwood High School, received a series of informal probations, diversions or citations.\nThe case has left lingering questions about how Wade was able to acquire the vast collection of weapons and crime paraphernalia found in the Richmond locker.\nSheriff's Deputy Greg Garrett, who was the lead investigator on the case, said Wade apparently financed his operations by selling marijuana and fake identifications to Marin County teens. Garrett said Wade generated \"significant\" revenue from the IDs, selling hundreds of them at $100 a pop.\nThe Glock handgun Wade tried to pull on detectives during his arrest had been purchased from another young associate for $500 worth of pot, authorities said. The associate, Carlos Ayala, was later convicted of selling it.\nAs for the gun used in the Mill Valley shooting, investigators traced it to a man who said he lost it some time ago during a move in the Sacramento area. It was unclear how it ended up in Wade's hands, Garrett said.\nGarrett also confirmed that investigators looked hard for links between Wade and the murder of Joan Rosenthal, the 75-year-old Tiburon woman shot to death outside her home in 2009. Investigators said Rosenthal was apparently pushed to the ground and shot at close range, and there was no evidence of a burglary.\nWade, who performed hundreds of Internet searches about the crimes for which he was convicted, also ran 54 searches on the Rosenthal slaying, Garrett said. Also, he was known to joke about the murder and the police.\nBut Wade was one of many possible angles that investigators explored, and sheriff's investigators neither sought charges against him nor ruled him out. The case is still open pending other developments.\n\"Max Wade is not connected to the Rosenthal case,\" said Dresow, his lawyer. \"A statement by investigators unsupported by fact or evidence dignifies no further response.\"\nContact Gary Klien via email atgklien@marinij.com orhttps://twitter.com/GaryKlien\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Max Wade\nMax Wade's booking photo at San Quentin State Prison.", "author": "By Gary Klien", "title": "Max Wade arrives at San Quentin as more details surface in Marin cases"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Corte Madera\nThe One Book One Marin kick-off event will be held at 7 p.m. Feb. 11 at Book Passage, 51 Tamal Vista Blvd. \nThe goal of One Book One Marin is to build a stronger, enriched community through library utilization, community dialogue, and the exploration of literature and culture.

Eventually, more than 90 percent will fail. \n\"People fail with their resolutions because they go to deep, try to do too much, and are too vague,\" says my friend and America's favorite professional organizer Peter Walsh, whom I called after stumbling on his \"31 Days 2 Get Organized,\" challenge, which is on his Facebook page.\n\"Which is exactly why I don't make any,\" I say. \"Why commit to something that will just make me feel bad about myself?\"\nBut as I review his challenge, which consists of spending just 10 minutes a day, every day, tackling one area of your home   your nightstand, your coats, your glassware   I see that success just may be in reach.\nI also think of what else losing weight and getting organized have in common: Both are best accomplished through small sustainable changes.\n\"Small steps consistently applied yield huge results,\" says Walsh.\n\"This is hard for me,\" I say. \"I approach everything kamikaze style or not at all.\" Then it occurs to me that maybe that's why I don't succeed. I then shut up and listen.\n\"Just 10 minutes a day. In one week, you've invested an hour or more and you'll see significant results,\" says Walsh. \"Hey, if 10 minutes turns into 15 or 20, I won't complain. That's the guerrilla nature of this.\"\nWalsh has posted a daily one-minute video for every day of the challenge. That leaves nine minutes to tackle the area. Go!\nAs Walsh and I speak, I open my desk drawer. It's a jumble of old bank receipts, a page of 33-cent stamps, ticket stubs to a U2 concert, dead batteries, a monkey wrench, an empty airline bottle of Bloody Mary mix, an expired passport and spools of adding machine tape for a machine I don't even own. Who did this? There is only one answer.\n\"So,\" I challenge the challenger, \"say in 31 days, you restore order, will it last?\"\nWalsh's answer reminds me of another principle getting organized and losing weight share.\nThose who succeed at losing weight and keeping it off substitute the word \"lifestyle\" for the word \"diet.\" Likewise, those who finally get organized and clutter free must substitute the word \"now\" for \"later.\"\n\"If you eliminate that one word from your vocabulary   I'll clean that later; I'll fold that later; I'll deal with that mail later   constant order will be yours,\" Walsh promises. \"Decisions delayed is the definition of clutter.\"\nBy now, I've dumped everything out of my desk drawer. I'm going in.\nThough Walsh designed the 31-day challenge to start Jan. 1 or Feb. 1, any date will work. Start the countdown now. Not later.\n*\nPick one drawer. It can be in the kitchen, bedroom or office. Empty it. Toss what you don't need and reorganize it, putting back in only what belongs, and like with like.\n*\nGet under one sink. Pull everything out. Wipe it down, then consolidate duplicates, put back only what goes there. Try putting all cleaning supplies in one plastic caddy. Make the space sparkling, decluttered and organized.\n*\nMake a donation basket. Get a laundry basket. Then go around the house and pick seven things to put in it to donate them. Keep the basket by the door you use to leave the house, and get in the habit of tossing items in there that others may appreciate, but that you don't need, use or love.\n*\nWrangle your recipes. I think I'm organized, but here's a weak spot. I have a little notebook crammed with food-stained folded pieces of papers bearing recipes that I've gathered over the years, the way a storm gathers clouds. It's a disorganized mess. Scan and digitally file them, said Walsh, then let them go. Or better, but more painful, toss them and make a pact with yourself that all recipes from now on will be digitized.\n*\nTackle the lower third. This is my favorite. Go into your closet, kitchen, office, or anywhere you have stacks of shirts, towels, papers or platters. Then pull out the lower third and get rid of it. \"It sounds drastic,\" says Walsh, \"but once people think about this they slap themselves up the side of their head. Of course! We tend to use or wear the same items over and over again. And they stay on the top of the pile. The lower third, we seldom or never use. That third is not so hard to tackle.\"\nSyndicated columnist Marni Jameson is the author of \"House of Havoc\" and \"The House Always Wins\" (Da Capo Press).

It's available online atwww.sgvcommunitygarden.net or at Gathering Thyme in San Anselmo. \nThe garden \"might be an unusual way to start a cookbook, but as gardeners and cooks, rich soil is where it all begins,\" says Liz Lauter, a community garden member and the cookbook's editor. \"These people are very interested in food. That is one thing that the 50 or more members of the community garden realized that they have in common.\"\nThe cookbook's 69 recipes are divided into eight sections: fresh starters, garden to salad plate, garden to dinner plate, soups and stews, breads and crackers, sauces and dressings, and sweet things. Cheryl Fromholzer, owner of Gathering Thyme in San Anselmo, a local herbalist and garden member, contributed recipes for healing foods and remedies.\nThe recipes are based on summer and fall produce. Not surprisingly, the zucchini, a prolific producer in the garden, also produced an abundance of recipes.\n\"The range was from zucchini chocolate cake to raw zucchini 'spaghetti',\" Lauter says with a chuckle. Her own \"amazing Gravenstein apple pie was a hit at one of our garden potlucks so that's in the book.\"\nMembers cherish these recipes, Lauter explains.\n\"We are as serious about growing food as we are about cooking and eating,\" she says.\nAnd this, she suggests, is what makes the \"Harvest Cookbook\" different from other cookbooks.\n\"Not many cookbooks are written by the people who grow the ingredients and our emphasis on healing foods is an aspect of cooking that is not usually included in most cookbooks,\" she says. \"We are really proud to share this aspect.\"\nLiz Lauter's Gravenstein apple pie\n\"Gravenstein apples make the best apple pies because they are sweet and tart, so get them if you can during their short season in early August here in Northern California,\" Lauter says. \"Otherwise, a Granny Smith or Pippin will do, but won't cause the wonderful uproar of delight when people taste this pie.\"\nMakes 10 to 12 servings\n8 large Gravenstein or Pippin apples peeled, cored, sliced in \u03a9-inch thick slices\nJuice of 2 lemons\n\u00e6 cup dark brown sugar\n1 tablespoon ground cinnamon\n2 cup unbleached white flour\n1 teaspoon salt\n2/3 cup vegetable oil\n4 tablespoons of milk\n\u00ba cup sweet butter, cut in 6 chunks\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees.\nFor the filling, prepare the apples and put them in large bowl with lemon juice, brown sugar and cinnamon.\nFor the dough, in medium mixing bowl, add flour, salt and stir.\nIn Pyrex measuring cup, fill to 2/3-cup level with vegetable oil; add milk to 1 cup level (it's about four tablespoons). Stir for a moment. Add to flour mixture.\nGently stir the ingredients with a fork, scraping the bottom of the bowl to get all of the flour and blend ingredients. Blend; don't over mix.\nRoll out the pie dough.\nLightly dampen a tabletop, and lay a large piece of wax paper down to stick to the table; put half of dough in middle of wax paper. Lay large sheet of wax paper on top of dough and press down by hand, then use a rolling pin and roll in all directions to make an even circular crust 1/8-inch thick.\nPeel off the top layer of wax paper.\nLift the bottom layer of wax paper from the table with pie dough attached and gently center the dough side down, into an ungreased standard deep-dish pie pan.\nPress the dough into shape of pan. Gently peel back the wax paper. Patch any holes or uneven edges with scraps of rolled dough. Let the rolled dough hang over edges of pan.\nPour the apple mixture into the pan, and arrange the apples to fit. Mound as necessary.\nDust the apple mountain with \u00ba of the flour, (1/8 tablespoon) salt and evenly space chunks of butter on the mountain.\nRoll out the second circle of dough the same way as the first.\nHolding the wax paper with dough side down, drape over the \"mountain\" of apples and gently peel off the wax paper.\nPress the dough at edges of pie together to seal the pie. Make a decorative crust edge.\nSlash five 1-inch cuts through the pie dough in a circle near the top of the pie to let any steam escape during baking.\nPut the pie in oven on a baking sheet.\nBake for 45 minutes. Let cool before serving so sugars can set into syrup and pie won't be too watery.\nPJ Bremier writes on home, garden, design and entertaining topics. She may be contacted at P.O.

No. 1 in the state was Manhattan Beach, where 439 homes in the $1 million-plus category were sold. \nThe year before, when DataQuick ranked Mill Valley 21st in the state for $1 million-plus sales, it said 215 such properties were sold in the city.\nMarin County Assessor Rich Benson shook his head at the latest DataQuick survey, wondering why it was noteworthy in a county where $1 million-plus home sales are routine.\nIn fact, Benson said, the survey is based on a different set of data and may have included homes sold in neighboring areas, because county records report 112 $1 million-plus sales within Mill Valley city limits last year, up from 95 the year before.\nThe county figures are based only on sales for which a price was disclosed. Andrew LePage, a DataQuick spokesman, said the firm uses a methodology that includes loan figures as well. Benson noted that while the San Diego firm relies on different data, \"the trend is clear\" about rising sales of million-dollar homes.\nIn terms of pricey transactions in Marin, sales of million-dollar homes soared in San Rafael, Sausalito and Corte Madera last year, Benson said. In San Rafael, sales of $1 million-plus homes tripled last year, rising to 106 from just 34 the year before.\nAnd as far as the Mill Valley market, \"It's no surprise,\" noted Nate Sumner, a Coldwell Banker broker who is president-elect of the Marin Association of Realtors. \"That's a psychologically important number, but it's almost the starting point in Mill Valley.\"\nDataQuick reported that across Marin, 1,016 homes sold for more than $1 million last year, up from 963 homes in 2012, and 730 in 2011.\nDataQuick said the number of California homes that sold for a million dollars or more was the highest in six years. Some 39,175 homes sold for $1 million or more across the state, up 45 percent from 2012. At the same time, home sales overall totaled 446,319 last year, down from 449,059 in 2012.\n\"The luxury home market is unique. ... It responds to its own set of economic factors,\" DataQuick CEO John Walsh said.\nThe firm said 840 homes sold for more than $5 million last year, a record. And a record 4,492 homes sold in the $2 million to $3 million range.\n\"The most expensive confirmed purchase last year was a 15,355-square-foot, eight-bedroom, 14-bathroom beachfront Malibu mansion built in 1993 which sold for $74,500,000,\" DataQuick reported.\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

I believe they now have the ability to do so.\nResponsible authorities at that time assured me and other state legislators that recycled water was 99.9 percent potable. Golf courses and other commercial enterprises were to be the initial primary users of such water.\nIn the past 20 years, our local water district has spent much time and money discussing desalinating water. I do not know if it has begun the infrastructure to distribute recycled water to residential users.\nI for one would be thrilled if I could irrigate my garden with recycled water. \nI am not afraid to drink it either. I really think it would taste the same as desalinated water or better.\nHaving lived here during the horrible drought of 1976-77, I do not want to relive all the things we had to do if there were simpler options.\nThe costs for \"purple pipes\" to distribute recycled water to residences may not even be as much as creating a desalinization plant.\nVivien Bronshvag, Kentfield\nVegans conserve water\nRegarding the IJ's Jan. 26 story, \"Drought scares West Marin's 'Cheese Sisters,'\" could the IJ please do a story on how cattle ranching ravages our planet and is actually a leading cause of drought instead of the usual portrayal of the rancher as an economic victim we should feel sorry for?\nIt's shocking all the talk about not flushing toilets and turning the tap off while brushing one's teeth as efforts to save water instead of discussing how more than half of all freshwater used in California goes to raising animals for food.\nAccording to statistics from the Water Footprint Network, a pound of beef requires 1,799 gallons of water to produce while a gallon of milk takes 880 gallons.\nIn contrast, 132 gallons of water are needed to grow a pound of wheat and 216 gallons to produce a pound of soybeans.\nWhy aren't our leaders talking about this? Why aren't they calling for a reduction in animal agriculture as a means to save water?\nIf we really care about conserving water   both for the drought at hand and for other droughts that are sure to follow as planet Earth heats up, we should stop subsidizing and supporting the incredibly destructive and wasteful livestock industry and reward those who grow (and eat) only plants instead.\nKim Flaherty, Mill Valley\nBan new hookups\nI read with interest the IJ's Jan. 22 article in which the Marin Municipal Water District is asking its customers for a 25 percent voluntary reduction in face of the severe drought.\nComparisons were also made to the drought that lasted from 1987 until 1992, noting this was the county's third consecutive dry year.\nWhile the majority of Marinites undoubtedly recognize the need for voluntary reductions, shouldn't the MMWD also be taking more proactive measures such as stopping the issuance of new taps until the water supply returns to a more sustainable level?\nMMWD need to look no further than down the block at the WinCup development that will be soon be providing an additional minimum of one shower a day at each of the 180 apartment units.\nSizeable projects are planned in Marinwood, Tam Valley, Strawberry and other areas of Marin.\nBefore approving more projects and hence increased water usage, the elected MMWD board needs assess our current water situation and act proactively.\nConservation by existing MMWD customers is needed but customers also need our elected MMWD board members to take decisive action.\nGary Denison, Mill Valley\nTRAILS\nRepairing the damage\nWhen the Marin County Bicycle Coalition recently learned about an illegal trail in Tam Valley, we immediately offered to help repair the damage.\nThis and other illegal trails highlight the damage that can be done both to the environment and to the image of the mountain bike community.\nWe do not accept or condone illegal trail construction and instead encourage people to work with the coalition to build sustainable trail projects.\nAs part of protecting our precious ecological resources, we are planning a habitat restoration project in Mill Valley and routinely work with state Parks and Marin County Parks to help maintain trails and remove invasive plants that crowd out native vegetation.\nTo address trail conflict, the coalition installed 1,000 bells on cyclists' bikes in 2013 and we just purchased another 1,000 bells for 2014. The bike bell provides a friendly greeting to other trail users when approaching from behind.\nMCBC is supporting (and acting as fiscal sponsor for) the Stafford Lake Bike Park in Novato. The 17-acre facility will have pump tracks, a dual slalom course, a perimeter trail, and will be constructed in full compliance with environmental regulations.\nIf successful, another bike park is planned for Ssouthern Marin. Facilities like these will ideally reduce illegally built bike stunts on public lands.\nWe are engaged in the county Parks Road and Trail Management Plan and revisions announced last week support new opportunities for mountain biking while reducing impacts on the environment.\nMCBC is working diligently to improve trail etiquette between users, reduce illegal construction and be ambassadors of land stewardship.\nLearn more about MCBC and the Stafford Lake Bike Park atwww.marinbike.org .\nTom Boss, off-road and events director, Marin County Bicycle Coaliton, Fairfax\nSAN DOMENICO\nLucky students\n\"... and you can't please all of the people all of the time\"   so goes the tune.\nIt was with interest that I read of San Domenico's decision to include male students in the year 2015. As a parent of a daughter who attended the school for 12 years, at which time it was an all-girls school, we know it was the best education available to her, and a nurturing environment.\nAnd now, as then, we trust that the Dominican Sisters and the board of directors have thoroughly researched this new facet of education at the school.\nIf parents choose to send their children to the school, we know that commitment is a sacrifice for many. Along with that commitment and sacrifice must come the trust in the administration that the choices made for the school are for the best intention of the students, parents and faculty.\nAdditionally, San Domenico has always welcomed a high percentage of scholarship students to provide the diversity that is an important strength of its mission. This fact further emphasizes its commitment to education, and I believe this still to be true.\nAt the time our children were young, there was no local school the caliber of San Domenico for our sons. The young men who will attend San Domenico School, grades nine through 12, are indeed lucky for the opportunity.\nJeanne Capurro, San Rafael\nHOUSING\n'Respectful' censorship?\nRegarding the Marin Board of Supervisors' new standards for public behavior at its meetings, supervisors have taken some considerable heat during \"open time for public expression\" lately, and in some cases, for good reason.\nTuesday's supervisors' meeting was a new low.\nThe supervisors have issued what could be construed as a \"soft warning\" to the public with a new statement on its weekly board agenda regarding how the public needs to behave and they are obviously targeting open time for public expression.\nThe Marin Board of Supervisors has included a new statement at the top of their weekly agenda, unveiled to the public at the Jan. 28 board meeting.\nIn essence, they are telling the public how to behave, presumably during open time for public expression. It states: \"The Marin County Board of Supervisors encourages a respectful dialogue that supports freedom of speech and values diversity of opinion. The board, staff and the public are expected to be polite and courteous and refrain from questioning the character or motives of others. Please help create an atmosphere of respect by not booing, whistling or clapping; by adhering to speaking time limits, and by silencing your cell phone.\"\nThe last two are obvious   adhering to the time limits is sometimes abused by speakers and silencing cell phones doesn't always happen. But to tell the public that we have to refrain from questioning the character and motives of others   presuming they mean of the board   is ridiculous.\nTrying to control the content of public expression at open time is not free speech. By the supervsiors' own actions this past year, which included their refusal to listen to the majority of the people who do not want high-density housing mandates, changes in zoning of suburban communities and Priority Development Area designations that will forever change the suburban landscape of our county, they have invited controversy into their chambers. Now, they can't deal with it.\nDon't criticize, don't question their motives and above all, no clapping.\nCarol Brandt, San Rafael\nState mandates\nI very much enjoyed Nels Johnson's article on housing in the Jan. 25 paper. He does a terrific job reporting on the issue of affordable housing.\nI truly sympathize with the residents of Strawberry, but some of us in Novato are happy that some Southern Marin residents are feeling the impact of the Association of Bay Area Governments, the Metropolitican Transportation Commissision, the state, and our ineffective county Board of Supervisors.\nNovato and San Rafael have contributed more than their fair share of affordable housing to the county, begging the question of why the state has any business mandating that local communities have an obligation to provide affordable housing.\nTwenty-nine years ago, we moved to Novato even though my job was in San Francisco, because that's what we could afford.\nSo I'm happy to see the uproar over the Priority Development Areas for Strawberry. It may result in uniting the entire county in opposition to these state mandates.\nAll the members of the current board should be replaced.\nTom James, Novato", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Feb. 1"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Saturday's local events\nCOLLEGE BASEBALL           Time           Place\nCOM at Hartnell           noon           Salinas\nCOLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nDominican at Dixie State           7:30 p.m.           St. George, Utah\nCOLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL           Time           Place \nDominican at Dixie State           5 p.m.           St. George, Utah\nCOLLEGE SOFTBALL           Time           Place\nDominican at Best of West (TH)           11 a.m.           Turlock\nCOLLEGE WOMEN'S TENNIS           Time           Place\nDominican at Sonoma State           11 a.m.           Rohnert Park\nHIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL           Time           Place\nBentley: San Domenico vs. Pinewood           3:30 p.m.           Bentley\nHIGH SCHOOL WRESTLING           Time           Place\nDrake, Redwood, MC at Dawn 2 Dusk           All day           Kentfield\nsunday's local events\nCOLLEGE SOFTBALL           Time           Place\nDominican at Best of West (DH)           10:15 a.m.           Turlock\nON THE AIR SaturDAY\nBASEBALL           Time           TV           Radio\nGiants Fan Fest           9 a.m.                     680 AM\nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL           Time           TV           Radio\nCoastal Carolina at Campbell           8 a.m.           ESPNU\nRichmond at VCU           8 a.m.           ESPN2\nFlorida Atlantic at Marshall           9 a.m.           CSN\nOhio State at Wisconsin           9 a.m.           ESPN\nGeorge Washington at Dayton           9:30 a.m.           NBCS\nKentucky at Missouri           10 a.m.           Ch. 5\nN.C.

The company also agreed to classify all employees as nonexempt from overtime laws and to honor minimum wage standards. \nThe suit was originally filed in 2012 by two tour leaders who claimed they worked 12 to 16 hours a day on their trips, with no rest time or meal breaks, and were essentially \"babysitting\" the teens around the clock. The tour leaders claimed their average hourly wage amounted to about $3.\nThe plaintiffs' law firm said 369 employees were eligible to join a class action and 317 participated. The compensation will amount to an average of $800, or more than half of what tour leaders were paid for their trips, said plaintiffs' attorney Bryan Schwartz of Oakland.\nScott von Eschen, president of the travel company, said he encouraged his employees to participate in the class settlement.\n\"At ARCC, we always felt that we were a summer camp and compensated our leaders accordingly,\" von Eschen said in prepared statement. \"When the Court ruled that our domestic training and U.S.-based programs fell under more traditional wage and hour regulations, we immediately adjusted our pay practices.\n\"Our leaders are incredibly loyal to to ARCC, which is why many of them return to work with us year after year, and I'm delighted they will get to participate in this settlement.\"\nThe settlement was approved last week by a federal judge in San Francisco.\nContact Gary Klien via email atgklien@marinij.com orhttps://twitter.com/GaryKlien", "author": "By Gary Klien", "title": "Mill Valley tourism firm settles lawsuit over alleged wage abuses"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Marin prosecution unit gets $95,000 in consumer action against Ohio firm\n\n\n\n\nThe Marin County District Attorney's Office will receive $95,000 as part of a settlement in a false advertising case against an Ohio company.\nThe Marin office and prosecutors from nine other California counties filed the civil lawsuit against Suarez Corporation Industries, also doing business as Bio Tech Research, and company president Brian Suarez. \nThe litigation was filed in 2012 by the California Nutritional Supplement Task Force, which includes the district attorney's offices of Marin, Alameda, Monterey, Napa, Orange, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Shasta, Solano and Sonoma counties.\nProsecutors claimed the company used false and misleading claims to market unapproved or \"misbranded\" food, drugs and medical devices in California.

The Marin County District Attorney's Office will get a 10 percent share of the civil penalties, which it will use to enforce consumer protection laws, said District Attorney Ed Berberian.\n\"Marin contributed attorney time for pre-filing investigation which included consulting with regulatory agencies and expert witnesses,\" Berberian said in an email. \"We engaged in the filing of pleadings ... and obtained a preliminary injunction; pre-trial discovery; and participated in mediation and settlement conferences.\"\nHe said the company has sold 1.2 million product units in California since 2000, but he did not know how many have been purchased by Marin consumers.\nThe company did not respond to email requests for comment.\nContact Gary Klien via email atgklien@marinij.com orhttps://twitter.com/GaryKlien\n -", "author": "By Gary Klien", "title": "Marin prosecution unit gets $95,000 in consumer action against Ohio firm"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Legacy 44, North Bay Christian Academy 34\nThe difference: Jaylen Jones led the way for North Bay (0-8) with 16 points and 14 rebounds but it wasn't enough in the loss to Legacy (2-6).

Pretty much anyone you ask will tell you that rabbits are cute, fuzzy and fun to watch. But how many of those people think of them as pets?\nAsk any shelter employee, and they will tell you that it generally takes a long time to find an adopter for a rabbit. This is unfortunate because rabbits make wonderful companions. \nThe Marin Humane Society always has a selection of adoptable rabbits to choose from. Many of our bunnies are found stray by caring citizens. Playful bunnies Steve and Guy were found hopping around San Rafael, while Honey Bunny was rescued from a Novato neighborhood. Other rabbits, such as Cookie and Muffin, seek out attention from staff and volunteers now that they are no longer living in small hutches outside. One of the most common reasons that pet rabbits are surrendered to MHS is the loss of interest by a child and parents who are unwilling to take on the rabbit's care.\nThere are many reasons to consider adding a bunny to your home. Rabbits are quiet, don't need to go outside for walks and can live with dogs and cats (with proper introduction, of course). There are many ways to house them inside or they can have free roam of a room or the entire house. Rabbits can be trained to use a litter box and sleep throughout the day when you are at work or school. Temperament-wise, their personalities are as varied as dogs and cats. Some bunnies just want to chill out near you while others will seek you out for attention. They enjoy being petted and like having a variety of chew toys around.\nRabbits also can be good pets for children. They are delicate, but if parents are involved in their care, children can be taught the proper way to pet, hold and pick up a rabbit.\nAdopting a rabbit is a big commitment, so researching their care in advance is essential. Like any animal they have specific needs. If you want to do it right, you need to educate your family. The Humane Society strongly encourages adopters to keep pet rabbits indoors. Rabbits love being near their human companions and need regular social interaction. A well-cared for indoor rabbit can live up to 12 years.\nPet rabbits can live safely outside, but their life span is shorter. In a proper outdoor environment, a rabbit can live eight to 10 years. We suggest adopting two rabbits if you will be keeping them outdoors. A rabbit living outside by itself is doomed to a life of boredom. While health and safety risks are greater for outdoor rabbits, with the proper housing and care, this can be a humane option. MHS can provide you with information on proper outdoor housing for rabbits and other things you'll want to be aware of if your family decides to go that route.\nRabbits don't need annual vaccinations, but they need to be examined by a veterinarian at least once a year. And, all rabbits should be spayed or neutered to help with behavior issues and, more importantly, to stop adding to their overpopulation. All rabbits at MHS are altered and microchipped prior to being made available for adoption. You can have your pet rabbit microchipped for $15.\nIf your family is considering a rabbit or two as a pet, do your research and then come to MHS with your questions. Just like dogs and cats, rabbits are interesting, entertaining, calming, and beautiful and will enrich your family's life for many years to come.\nSuzanne Gollin is the foster care coordinator and small companion animal evaluator for the Marin Humane Society, which contributes Tails of Marin articles.

While that has spelled bad news for some species, it also triggered an explosion of bright yellow Acacia shrubs in the Golden Gate National Seashore as well as red buds on the tips of the cherry trees in South Bay orchards.\nJust how peculiar is January's weather?\nBetween Jan. 3 and 5, San Rafael set new records for highs. Between Jan. 15 and 20, Kentfield set record highs for three days, with one day hitting 70 degrees. San Jose and San Francisco topped previous high-temperature records by 4 degrees. Oakland's high for the month, 77, was 20 degrees warmer than normal.\nAround the Bay Area, cities broke high-temperature records 18 out of 30 days. Fourteen of those days were consecutive.\nIt's also been one of the driest Januaries, too.\nMarin set a record low for rainfall: just 0.01 of an inch for the month. The previous low was 0.31 of an inch set in 1976.\nSanta Cruz has had less rain this season than Death Valley. Only 1.34 inches have fallen since July in normally wet Surf City while Furnace Creek has had 1.43 inches.\nWhat's going on? A persistent high-pressure system   dubbed the \"ridiculously resilient ridge\" by meteorologists   has diverted all the cold air from California and transformed Atlanta, Washington D.C. and New York into one giant ice chest, according to meteorologist Jan Null of Golden Gate Weather Service.\n\"I don't see any huge pattern shifts that will turn on the hose,\" he said, although a smattering of rain could come this weekend.\nThe Sierra was blanketed in white powder early Thursday, but the Department of Water Resources measured only 2 inches of snow water equivalent   12 percent of normal for the date.\nThe warm midwinter means an early start for one of San Francisco's most breathtaking annual natural marvels, the \"Magnificent Magnolias\" exhibit at the Golden Gate Park's Botanical Garden, which is erupting in a fragrant riot of pink and white, curator Don Mahoney said.\nBouquets of blossoms also are bursting at Tilden Regional Park's Botanic Garden in the north Berkeley hills, said Bart O'Brien, garden manager. Giant houndstongue? Check. Star lilies? Check. Douglas iris? Ceanothus? Check, check.\n\"We're a month, even two months, early,\" he said. Even wildflowers such as shooting star and milkmaids are up, he said.\nDecember's cold snap   remember that?   sent most of our migrating Monarch butterflies fluttering to parts unknown, but the first butterflies of the spring season are flying into view. Turtles, typically slumbering in cool winter mud, are swimming in ponds.\nBut underlying the balmy weather is a growing sense that something's not right.\n\"There are reports of almost no wildflowers on (Novato's) Mount Burdell,\" Smith said. \"I've seen a few poppies along he coast, but not many. There are fewer seeds, which means less food for birds. It's all negative.\"\nAnd without rain, the winter chorus of Pacific tree frogs has gone silent. The annual migration of newts across Tilden's South Park Drive into Wildcat Creek near Berkeley is on hiatus; last weekend, Pleasanton's \"Newt Festival\" was canceled. Some wells have run dry. Ski slopes are bare. Ranchers are downsizing their herds. Some cities are looking at empty reservoirs.\nPresident Barack Obama on Wednesday called Gov. Jerry Brown to express his concern over the historic drought here.

Bogut is currently third, behind Indiana's Roy Hibbert and Paul George and just ahead of Indiana's David West.\nAnd Green is sixth, behind Chicago's Joakim Noah and just ahead of Tim Duncan, DeAndre Jordan, Lance Stephenson and George Hill.\nBy the way, this is a very good stat, I should point out. Last season, the top five in defensive rating were: Tim Duncan, Hibbert, George, Tony Allen and eventual Defensive Player of the Year Marc Gasol.\nWhich got me thinking, I'm not big on All-Star berths or some other award stuff, but I do value the NBA All-Defense teams, when they're picked correctly, and I think Bogut has a shot at one of them this season.\nThis is also relevant because Bogut has bonus clauses in his new deal that kick in for every season that he plays at least 65 games and also is named to the 1st or 2nd team All-Defense (among other triggers, but the All-Defense is the most likely).\nThe last time a Warriors player finished top 20 in defensive ratings was in 1988-89, when the legendary Manute Bol finished 17th in the defensive ratings.\nThat is a long time ago, but what a great name to come back to, however.\nThe last time a Warrior player finished in the top 5: When Robert Parish hit No. 1 in 1978-79.\nblogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami/", "author": "Bay Area News Group", "title": "Combing the blogs: Bogut and Green getting it done on defense for Warriors"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Mill Valley seniors cope with $33 million Redwoods 'revitalization' project\n\n\n\n\nAS IT BRACES for \"the silver tsunami,\" the huge wave of baby boomers reaching retirement age, the Redwoods in Mill Valley is launching the first major remodeling project in its 40-year history.\nGround on the $32.8 million \"revitalization\" will be officially broken in ceremonies at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday at the renowned nonprofit senior community, a landmark at 40 Camino Alto near the Mill Valley Community Center and Tamalpais High School.\n\"A lot of the things we're doing are for this generation, but also for future generations,\" said CEO Barbara Solomon. \"We have quite a range of needs to meet.\" \nSix years in the planning, the first phase of the multi-year effort will include building a wellness center, improving and expanding the dining room and kitchen, redesigning and enlarging the entry and lobby and installing energy-saving double-pane windows and water-conserving landscaping.\nWork has begun on the modernization of the 150 independent living units, a job that includes new kitchens and bathrooms. While they are being remodeled, occupants are being moved temporarily to residential apartments on the opposite side of the 10-acre grounds. No one has had to move off campus.\nGordon and Helen Anderson are among the first to be moved into an apartment while their place is being gutted and redone.\n\"It's like being on a trip somewhere,\" Mrs. Anderson, an 87-year-old retired school teacher, said, looking out her window at a view of Mount Tamalpais. \"It's a different place.\"\nTheir temporary quarters don't have a kitchen, so they've had to get used to having their meals in the dining room.\nThe Andersons, who moved into the Redwoods four years ago, donated to the revitalization capital campaign and are excited about the improvements, seeing the modernization as a way the Redwoods can compete with newer, more up-to-date senior communities. But not everyone is as enthusiastic about it as they are.\n\"There are some people who resisted it and some who are for it,\" Mrs. Anderson said. \"What is it about change that's hard for people?\"\nWhen residents have questions or grievances, they are free to air them at a weekly update and briefing on the progress of the ambitious project. And they do.\n\"I know there is concern,\" Solomon said. \"I wouldn't expect there not to be. They can yell and scream if they want to, but not too many do. But some of these folks are in their 90s and 100s and when they moved into their apartments, they thought nothing was ever going to change for them. So we have a relocation coordinator, and we're really hand-holding them through the process.\"\nThe Redwoods' 337 residents range in age from their mid-60s to more than 100 (the oldest is 104). The average age is 87, but the population appears to be on a younger trend. At a meeting of newcomers at the beginning of the year, three identified themselves as Vietnam War veterans, an indication that the long-awaited baby boomers are starting to move in.\n\"We've been waiting for them, and there they were,\" Solomon said. \"Standard in facilities today are things like a wellness center, a cafe and apartments with modern amenities. Those are very important things for them.\"\nBecause seniors are more active and health conscious than they were when the Redwoods opened in 1972, the new wellness and fitness center will feature a therapy pool and hot-water spa.\n\"About 80 percent of our population is living through some kind of pain every day,\" Solomon noted. \"In dealing with pain, you want to be exercising and active and soaking in hot water.\"\nTwo-thirds of residents eat one or more meals a day in the dining room. Under the revitalization, it will be expanded and redesigned and the kitchen, which serves more than 400 meals a day, will gets its first updating and remodeling in 35 years.\nThe project is being paid for by $28.2 million in bond financing, $2 million from the Redwoods' reserves and $1.6 million from community contributions, leaving slightly less than $1 million still to raise.\nRents range from $1,674 for independent living units up to $2,974 for apartments. New residents moving into revitalized units will be charged about 15 percent more, but administrators say they do not expect any major rent increases for current residents because of the remodeling.\nPhase one is projected to be finished by the middle of next year. Phase two   the construction of 40 new affordable housing units   begins when phase one is completed.\n\"With people living here, we can't do everything at once,\" Solomon said. \"This is such a great community, you have to help them maintain some level of peace and quiet.\"\nContact Paul Liberatore via email atliberatore@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Artist rendering of the Wellness Center at The Redwoods in Mill Valley.

Schornstein drove the lane for a bucket, Harris dropped in two free throws. The Giants made it a 6-1 run when Rosenthal scored inside   her first points of the period   on a perfect bounce pass from Harris.\nThe Giants sealed the victory at the line as Schornstein and Rosenthal combined to sink seven of eight free throws in the final 1:08.\nContact Tim Menicutch via email atsports@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Ariella Rosenthal (31) of Redwood dribbles toward the basket trailed by Isabel Jennings (24) of Justin-Siena during their game in Larkspur, Calif. on Friday, Jan. 31, 2014.

For Bean and Alan Finneran, it's all about drama.\nNot emotional drama   theatrical.\nIt began in the late 1960s when they staged elaborate and edgy multimedia performances together, first in Boston and then in San Francisco, where they founded SOON 3, a celebrated avant-garde theater company that ran from 1972 to 1999.\nWhile they no longer are involved in theater, those experimental experiences inform their current works   for Alan Finneran it's photography and for his wife of 44 years it's site-specific installations of hand-rolled ceramic sculptures. \nIn conscious and sometimes unconscious ways, their theatrical background has found a way into their artworks.\n\"I really arrive in a space and have to create the show, the installation, in the space like the theater. I love that, arriving in an empty space and deciding where to put things,\" says Bean Finneran, 65, who works out of a house studio on the Boardwalk directly across from the family home they recently sold. \"And with my work, you have to be really careful about where you choose to set it up because you can't move it without taking it completely apart.\"\n\"Bean and I are similar in that we let the work lead us. We're not sure where it's going and then suddenly you discover something,\" says Alan Finneran, 69, who most recently has been using his collection of antique toys to tell lighthearted stories about two fictional characters, Diamond Jim and Lily of the West, in his photography. \"I didn't plan on them looking theatrical, but they look exactly like a scene from a performance.\"\nThe Finnerans have a dual exhibit at the Bolinas Museum through March 16   the first time the couple, who split their time between Greenbrae and Calistoga, have had an exhibit in Marin.\nBoth like to play with scale. Actually, both like to play, period. In Bean Finneran's case, it's grouping together thousands of often vividly colored rolled and slightly curved clay pieces, but not permanently. Nothing holds the pieces intact but gravity and the way she interweaves them. That allows her to reuse them, and shape and reshape her sculptures to truly reflect where they're displayed. Each time she creates an installation, her sculptures are never quite the same. One sculpture, which created a stir when it was installed in an ancient chapel in Vallauris, France, was 30 feet long with about 75,000 clay pieces, give or take.\nA former longtime clay jeweler, she decided she wanted to shake up things when she turned 50. A disappointing attempt to paint led her back to working with clay. She didn't plan to make clay cones; it just happened.\n\"In the practice of art there is a lot that happens that's not planned, that happens just from the action of working with your hands. When I moved out here to the marsh I knew I wanted to make something abstract, something connected to nature, and so the most basic part of my work that's connected to nature is that everything can be transformed into different shapes. It's transitory,\" she says.\nThe marsh grasses, which are constantly transforming and shifting throughout the day and the tides, spoke to her.\n\"I didn't make anything like this until I moved out here,\" she says. \"Clearly what I do is such a reflection of where I live.\"\nA reflection, but not a mirror image.\n\"I don't feel like I have to imitate the color of the marsh grasses to evoke that universal process of continual change. So I use colors that are very unnatural just for the beauty of them,\" she says. \"I love color.\"\nHer work offers \"a romantic vision of life close to nature,\" writes contemporary ceramics curator Yves Peltier. \"Her privileged observation of nature has enabled her to see the unchanging forces and principles that lay behind the apparent disorder of the spectacle that life offers.\"\nThere are some romantic visions happening for Alan Finneran, too, as he explores the mythology of the Old West through Diamond Jim's relentless pursuit of the elusive Lily.\n\"They're telling me stories. I mess around with these things. I just set them up and they tell me something, and sometimes they tell me they want something else,\" he says. \"It's a grand excuse for me to go back to my childhood and play with toys again. That's what all art is, it's a form of play.\"\nWhile his current photography is playful and doesn't speak to any weighty topics, as his provocative photography had in the past, it does have a message nonetheless, he says.\n\"My message always as an artist is to trust your intuition. Honor it and trust it,\" he says.\n\"And don't censor it constantly in case it doesn't have enough meaning,\" she adds.\nAdvice they follow themselves.\nVicki Larson can be reached atvlarson@marinij.com ; follow her on Twitter at @OMGchronicles and Facebook atwww.facebook.com/vlarson\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: Bean Finneran's \"Spectra\" and Alan Finneran's \"Set Ups: The Further Adventures of Diamond Jim & Lily of the West\"\nWhen: Through March 16: 1 to 5 p.m. Fridays, noon to 5 p.m. weekends\nWhere: Bolinas Museum, 48 Wharf Road, Bolinas\nAdmission: Free\nInformation: 868-0330;www.bolinasmuseum.org ;www.beanfinneran.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: A piece of ceramic art by Bean Finneran sits in her home studio on Thursday, Jan. 16, 2014, in Greenbrae, Calif.

That criteria would reduce the 30-units-per-acre development standard handed down by Sacramento to 20 units, which is much more in keeping with local development patterns.\nLevine's bill makes sense to anyone who has been watching local fights over affordable housing.\nThose fights aren't getting housing built. They are digging trenches.\nMarin's existing designation as a \"metropolitan\" area where 30-units-per-acre blocks of buildings are needed to get housing constructed has little to do with people who are going to be living with those developments.\nThis county doesn't have many large apartment complexes and it doesn't have much room for many more.\nThe 30-units-per-acre standard was borne of developers' estimation that they need those densities to make affordable housing affordable to builders. There should have been an open and public process to determine local standards, not have Sacramento take it upon itself to design local communities.\nPrevious attempts to get the state to revise that standard have failed to gain political traction due to opposition from affordable housing builders and lawmakers who question why Marin should be excused from a standard that other counties have no problem meeting.\nThis is Levine's second try. His first housing bill was gutted and replaced by legislation to let the county open space district chief spend up to $25,000 without first getting board approval.\nLevine says he thinks he has housing advocates and other lawmakers onboard to support his new bill. It would only affect Marin and counties with populations of less than 400,000 that are on the edge of metropolitan areas. His bill designates these areas as \"suburban.\"\nHis political acumen will be tested by this bill   Assembly Bill 1537.\nSupervisor Judy Arnold, who has helped write the bill, says Marin isn't opposed to building affordable housing, it just wants to meet its regional fair share without building large housing complexes.\n\"We just don't want to have to see it at 30 units per acre because that's just not who we are,\" Arnold said.\nLevine's bill gives Marin the flexibility to prove to the state that it can work toward meeting its state-defined fair share. It also removes an obstacle that stands to get in the way of housing actually being built rather than promised in a bureaucratic report.\nThat's the point of Levine's bill and should be the point of the state's housing goals.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Marc Levine checks the election results online with his Field Director, Robert Mason, 20, of San Rafael, at the election night party at Aurora Art Studio in San Rafael, Calif. on Tuesday, November 6, 2012.(Special to the IJ/Jocelyn Knight) Jocelyn Knight", "author": "Editorial", "title": "Editorial: Levine's housing bill provides Marin flexibility"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Boys basketball\nMARIN CATHOLIC 65, REDWOOD 64\nMCAL\nRedwood           17           13           17           17                       64 \nMC           14           17           16           18                       65\nREDWOOD Bullock 3 0-0 8, Sullivan 3 3-4 11, Thompson 2 2-6 6, Jones 6 2-5 16, Kennedy 5 1-2 15, Breck 3 1-2 8.

He wrote in his journal that they should be called the Conspiracy of Beards.\nFourteen years later, his dream will be onstage at the 142 Throckmorton Theatre in Mill Valley on Feb. 7 in the form of a 30-voice male choir devoted to the celebrated singer-songwriter-poet's music. They are believed to be the only choir on the planet that performs Cohen's songs exclusively.\nKadyk, who was 32 when he died, never got to hear the choir himself. But, at the behest of his wife, Anah, a group of 11 of his friends got together and sang a few Cohen songs as a tribute to him at an event in 2003. \nThat was meant to be a one-off performance, but it led to an invitation to sing at famed City Lights Bookstore in North Beach.\n\"And it snowballed from there,\" said 38-year-old Clay Eugene Smith, who joined the choir three years ago and now serves as its publicist.\nFour of the original members are still in the choir, including 61-year-old Peter Whitehead, one of a handful of professional musicians in the group. He became a fan of Cohen's when he was 18, and his admiration for the now 79-year-old icon has never flagged.\n\"I think his words are incredible,\" he said. \"I've always been fascinated by the mood of his songs, and he's one of the few songwriters of his generation who've really lasted, writing material that's timeless.\"\nOver the past 11 years, something like 100 men have passed through the choir, not all of them bearded. Members range in age from their 20s to their 60s. The majority are amateurs with day jobs and varying degrees of musical experience.\n\"I was told there are two requirements to join: an appreciation of Cohen's music and seeing the choir perform at least once,\" Smith said. \"Even though facial hair is not required, I think I was asked to join because of my giant beard. But we have started to ask prospective members, 'Can you sing?' although sometimes people slip through the cracks on that one.\"\nChoir members dress in Cohen-esque ladies' man cool   suit, tie, fedoras optional. One of the original members wears a Vietnamese rice paddy hat.

Jerry Brown's image as a responsible, penny-pinching steward of California's finances has been cemented in recent weeks because of his renewed call to pay off California's \"wall of debt.\"\nThat's a term Brown coined when he took office to describe the tens of billions of dollars California owed to public schools and special funds whose coffers were raided to help balance budgets in the past. \nBut look behind that $24.9 billion wall and you'll see a $330 billion skyline of other liabilities threatening the state's financial health. It includes $80 billion needed to cover teachers' pensions and $64 billion to pay for state workers' health care in retirement   two particularly troublesome liabilities because the state isn't even making the minimum payments on them.\nAs a result   similar to the debt of a homeowner who fails to make regular mortgage payments   California's liabilities keep growing. For example, the money needed to fully fund the California State Teachers' Retirement System balloons by $22 million a day, or about $8 billion a year, financial analysts estimate.\n\"This is an enormous financial problem that no one is willing to stand up and take care of,\" said Joe Nation, a public policy professor at Stanford University and former Marin assemblyman.\nThe governor acknowledged California's unfunded liability burden last week in his State of the State address, calling it \"enormous and ever-growing.\" In his proposed budget, he specifically calls for negotiations to resolve the teacher pension issue. But he includes no money for the upcoming fiscal year to pay down that liability.\n\"We can't make a snap judgment on this,\" said H.D. Palmer, spokesman for the state Department of Finance. \"The prudent approach is coming up with a long-term plan that's bought into by all stakeholders, and that will take time.\"\nThose stakeholders include the Legislature, school districts, CalSTRS and the teachers, whose unions Brown is expected to rely on for campaign donations and community outreach when, as is expected, he runs for re-election this fall.\nNonpartisan budget analysts, however, say the state shouldn't waste any more time and should start setting aside money to pay down the CalSTRS debt. Indeed, analysts say, it might be smarter to put funds toward CalSTRS rather than accelerating the payments to retire the \"wall of debt,\" as Brown has chosen to do. That's because the interest rates for pension liabilities are higher.\nOn the issue of retiree health care, the state hasn't set aside money for future expenses, instead opting to directly pay the costs as they arise. But if the state started saving now for the future cost of coverage that's been promised to state workers in retirement, that would trigger accounting changes. As a result, the state could reduce its long-term liabilities by $20 billion almost immediately, said Ryan Miller, a senior analyst in the state's Legislative Analyst's Office.\nWhile teachers' pensions and retiree health care have gotten the most attention, they're not the only liabilities.\nAlmost $65 billion is needed to pay for deferred maintenance of state roadways, bridges and other infrastructure.\nNearly $9 billion is owed to the federal government for unemployment benefits that have been borrowed over the years.\nThe University of California pension and retiree health care plans are $25 billion underfunded.\nHow it happened\nCalifornia's pension funds were not always woefully underfunded. In fact, in the late 1990s they were flush with cash.\nThe stock market was on fire and capital-gains taxes were soaring thanks to the dot-com boom, and many Californians seemed confident that the state would never again have a tough time economically, Stanford's Nation said.\nIn Sacramento, Democrats controlled both houses of the Legislature in 1999, the same year a new Democratic governor, Gray Davis, took office after 16 years of Republican governors. The political alignment and \"irrational exuberance\" about California's financial future led lawmakers and local officials to dramatically increase pension benefits at the same time the state, cities and counties were allowed to decrease contributions to the funds.\n\"All you can do is govern for your time,\" Davis said in a recent interview. \"The pensions were appropriate assuming we could afford it, but subsequent events, including the Great Recession, proved we could not afford it and must adjust.\"\nIn the years after the dot-com bubble burst in late 2000 and early 2001, CalSTRS and the even-larger California Public Employees' Retirement System lost tens of billions of dollars. And when the global financial crisis hit in 2008, they lost tens of billions more.\nAt CalPERS, even though the stock market eventually rebounded, investment returns since 1999 haven't lived up to the predictions. That's one of the reasons the unfunded liability for the pensions of state workers and judges is $48.6 billion.\nPension reform signed by Brown in 2011 reduced pension benefits for new workers, meaning most of the savings will be years away. Critics such as San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed, who hopes to get a pension measure on November's statewide ballot, have said the reform didn't go far enough.\nThe way out will likely require additional payments from the state, school districts, teachers and state workers, but figuring out who pays what will be tough, said Larry Gerston, a political science professor at San Jose State.\nLabor leaders are the \"bread and butter\" of Brown's campaign operation, Gerston said, so tussling with them over such a thorny issue in an election year would not be wise.\n\"Whatever you want to say about Jerry Brown, you can't accuse him of being fiscally irresponsible,\" he said. \"Down the road, I expect we'll see reform here.\"\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: California Governor Jerry Brown, left, talks with General Manager for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California Jeffrey Kightlinger during a meeting in Los Angeles Thursday, Jan 30, 2014.

But in 2011, a crackdown launched by Melinda Haag, the San Francisco-based U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California, shut down the Marin Alliance. \nHaag threatened Shaw's landlord, Farshid Ezazi of Orinda, with confiscation of his School Street building if he continued to allow the dispensary to operate there. The Fairfax dispensary was among dozens statewide that federal prosecutors said they targeted due to their proximity to parks, schools and other facilities used by children.\nAt about the same time, Shaw said she was notified by the Internal Revenue Service that she owed more than $10 million in back taxes; the IRS was disallowing all of the Marin Alliance's business deductions.\nShaw, who says she is broke, returned to Marin this week from Los Angeles, where she was living with friends. She came back to auction off memorabilia from the Marin Alliance in an attempt to generate money to help cover the mortgage on her Fairfax house, which she has rented out.\n\"I've had two years of hell, and it's not fair,\" Shaw said. \"I'm basically still being persecuted for inventing the licensed dispensary system, which started a revolution.\"\nShaw said she initially appealed the IRS order, and the agency has decided to allow her deductions for buying the cannabis she sold to members of the collective. The IRS is, however, continuing to try to collect the remaining $3 million from her.\n\"I was handling a lot of cash, but I had bills to pay,\" Shaw said. \"We got audited twice a year for the first five years. We proved time after time that we were honest and broke.\"\nTo get her license to operate in Fairfax, Shaw had to comply with 84 conditions set by the town's Planning Commission.\nShaw said she has no money to mount a legal defense. She said the IRS confiscated the $10,000 in savings that she had. Her car has been repossessed. And she was recently notified that her future Social Security retirement benefits have been zeroed out.\n\"I'm going to be declaring bankruptcy shortly,\" Shaw said.\nFairfax Councilman Larry Bragmann said, \"It's very sad and very unfair. It's not right when somebody has the courage to pioneer a project like this and ends up getting punished for their courage.\"\nBragmann said, \"Here you had a legal, regulated dispensary, which was really the model for what could be done for the patients, and right now in progressive Marin there is not one legal dispensary for patients.\"\nSteve DeAngelo, director of the Harborside Health Center in Oakland, one of the largest dispensaries in the nation, said, \"Our case is quite similar to Lynnette's, except since we are a corporation instead of a sole proprietorship. I will hopefully not find myself in the same situation as Lynnette.\n\"It is a really, really horrible way for somebody who gave of herself so generously as Lynnette did to be paid back by the community,\" DeAngelo said.\nDeAngelo said the IRS has notified Harborside it owes $2.4 million in back taxes for its first two years of operation, and he expects the agency to increase that amount, since it is in the process of auditing subsequent years of operation.\nHarborside is challenging the IRS on those assessments and is also battling an attempt by Haag to seize the building in which it operates. DeAngelo said the city of Oakland has so far blocked confiscation of the building on the basis that it would harm public health and safety.\nDeAngelo remains hopeful that federal prosecutors will have a change of heart. He noted that earlier this month Attorney General Eric Holder said the Obama administration would soon roll out new regulations making it easier for banks to do business with legal marijuana sellers.\nRecreational marijuana use is now legal in two states, Washington and Colorado, and another 18 states have legalized cannabis for medical purposes. An initiative to legalize marijuana in California may appear on the November 2014 ballot. A Field Poll released in December reported that 55 percent of Californians support legalization.\nDeAngelo is also optimistic about Harborside's chances of prevailing in its fight to keep the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California from seizing the buildings it occupies.\nMatt Pappas, a Long Beach lawyer, said he successfully represented five clients last year whose property the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California was attempting to seize because medical marijuana dispensaries were operating there.\n\"The government dismissed the cases with prejudice,\" Pappas said, \"and in several of the cases, the collectives that were on the property remained in operation.\"\nPappas asserted that Haag, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California, is failing to follow Department of Justice policy.\n\"She is fully out of compliance with her boss, who is Deputy Attorney General James Cole,\" Pappas said. \"She is off the reservation.\"\nLillian Ara\u02d9z Haase, a spokeswoman for Haag, did not respond to a request for comment.\nContact Richard Halstead via e-mail atrhalstead@marinij.com .

The case will now go to the United States Supreme Court who may agree to hear it. \nBut the Ninth Circuit decision is very odd because, again and again, it puts a thumb on the scale.\nFirst, it needlessly disparages   or at least trivializes   one side in the dispute. The opinion begins:\n\"This appeal, which pits an oyster farm, oyster lovers and well-known \"foodies\" against environmentalists aligned with the federal government, has generated considerable attention in the San Francisco Bay Area.\"\nWhile the court appears to take judicial notice of the public debate, it apparently does not acknowledge that sustainable agriculture is an environmentalist concern, and, most importantly, that there are environmentalists on both sides of the dispute. The court puts a thumb on the scale.\nSecond, the court disregards a universal legal maxim, general rules are understood broadly while exceptions, narrowly. In administrative law, the general rule is that courts have jurisdiction to review all governmental action. There are some exceptions to that general rule, but the exceptions should be narrowly applied. However, in the oyster farm case, the court oddly gives a very broad application to an exception   Article 124   the court thus prevents itself from looking into irregularity in the Secretary of the Interior's oyster farm decision. The court puts a thumb on the scale.\nThird, the court muddles the geography of the oyster farm by failing to distinguish clearly between those parts of the farm that are within the wilderness zone and those parts that, like the farm buildings of the neighboring dairy ranches, are within the pastoral zone.\nOnly the oyster beds are within the wilderness. But by confuting the pastoral and wilderness zones, the buildings and the beds, the court leaves the impression of far greater impact on the wilderness. The court puts a thumb on the scale.\nFourth, the court treats the legislative intent at the creation of the seashore and the wilderness as something that can be lightly brushed aside by some sort of (in this case, merely tacit) indication of changed intent. However, the initial legislative intent that the agriculturalists   including the oyster farm   would continue to have their use permits renewed was part of the historic bargain between environmentalists and agriculturalists that created the seashore. As anyone who has seen the film \"Rebels With a Cause\" knows, without that bargain, the lands would have been lost to the urbanization of commercial real estate development. By ignoring the reality of the seashore's origins, the court puts a thumb on the scale.\nGiven the historic bargain that preserved the seashore, it is absolutely outrageous to argue that the agriculturalists somehow gave up their traditional use of the land when they were in fact protecting it by transferring ownership to the Park Service.\nSustainable agricultural use has been an inextricable part of the texture of the seashore since its creation.\nThe Ninth Circuit's unfair decision ignores that primordial reality and should now be taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nJim Linford of Marinwood is a semi-retired appellate attorney who has filed a pro bono amicus brief in support of the oyster farm on behalf of an historic resource foundation\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Drakes Bay Oyster Company on Drakes Estero in the Point Reyes National Seashore, Calif. on Wednesday, November 21, 2012.(Special to the IJ/Jocelyn Knight)", "author": "By Jim Linford Guest op-ed column", "title": "Marin Voice: Oyster ruling deserves another look"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "As a Drake High assistant, John Legnitto helped a struggling football team rise from the MCAL cellar to the playoffs.\nNow fully in charge, he wants to \"keep the good times going.\" \nLegnitto is the Pirates' newest head coach, athletic director Peter Donoff announced Thursday.

Hopefully I can break it (soon).\"\nBut 59 was plenty to claim the overall title.\n\"Having coached (Chavez), I knew it was over once I saw him smiling,\" said Drake boys coach Doug Donnellan, who tied Chavez for overall honors during the first free-throw competition when both players sank 39 when Chavez was an eighth-grader. \"Once he gets in a groove (at the line), it usually is a long time before he misses.\n\"Plus, it's a great cause and a great way to give back to your community.\"\nProceeds from the event go toward the local branch of the St. Vincent De Paul Society in Fairfax, which helps provide food, clothes, utility payments, rental assistance and other basic living requirements for families in need.\nTournament founder Jack Hayes expects several hundred to compete in ages ranging from preschool kids to senior citizens with more than 40 categories in which players can compete for trophies.\n\"It's had a good run for a great cause,\" Hayes said. \"There is a lot of participation. People have a good time. I am surprised how many people stay and watch.\"\nDrake starting senior guard Sam Dines was Chavez's rebounder last year and plans to resume his duties on Saturday.\n\"I remember people started to notice (Chavez) was shooting (last year) and started gathering around,\" Dines said. \"I try to keep it low key (for him) and not make a big deal out of it. I just try to give him a nice bounce pass. He's just pretty automatic.\"\nChavez's good shooting development can be traced back to his days as a kid shooting inside on a nerf hoop attached to a chair with his older brother Neal (playing for College of Marin basketball team this season) and dad Bucky (all-league player for Drake in the late '70s).\nWhile Bucky helped him with his form, his mom, Susan, helped instill the notion of \"listening to the ball.\"\nApparently Chavez has become a very good listener.\nContact Derek Arild via e-mail atdarild@marinij.com\nFREE THROW CHAMPIONSHIPS\n* When: Saturday, 8:30 a.m. to noon\n* Where: Drake High gym in San Anselmo\n* Who: Contest open to adults and children who can compete in any individual, team, family, age and gender categories leading to an overall champion\n* To enter: Cost is $5 for ages 13 and under and $10 for everyone else to pay at the door.\n\nOverall boys/girls winners\n2009: Lucas Chavez, Lagunitas Middle School, Doug Donnellan, coach, Drake High, tied; Lauren Toy, Redwood High (varsity)\n2010: Andy Polochek, Drake (varsity); Sophie Bloom, Mill Valley\n2011: Sam Brown, San Rafael High (varsity); Cassie Howard, Drake\n2012: Tony Caletti, Branson (varsity); Ashleigh VandenBrink, Davis High\n2013: Lucas Chavez, Drake (varsity); Hannah Casey, San Jose Middle School\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Marin County free throw champ and Drake graduate Lucas Chavez shoots some hoop outdoors at Drake High School in San Anselmo, Calif. on Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2014.

Work was to be completed this month. \nBut the community had concerns about the plan, ranging from a design that could limit views, to fish heads left on the dock that would attract rats and raccoons, to fishing weights that could smash through the windows of the adjacent Trident restaurant.\nThe city's Planning Commission also weighed in, voting against the dock's design. But earlier this month the City Council approved the project, pointing out the dock's historic nature and its general public benefit.\n\"At one time this pier was here, but nature took it away from this community,\" said Councilman Herb Weiner. \"The way it is now, it's an eyesore.\"\nThe dock is just south of the Trident/Ondine restaurant complex at 558 Bridgeway. If all goes to plan, reconstruction of the pier   which is 75 feet long and 25 feet wide   would be finished by the end of May. The pier will be for foot traffic only; there will be no boat access. Fishing will be allowed, but the city will look at that activity after a year to see if there are any problems.\nThe building that houses the restaurants was built in 1898 by the San Francisco Yacht Club, and through the early 1920s the building served as a center for gala parties, yacht races and regattas, according to the Ondine website. An early fire station was also at the site and a plaque noting it could be part of the new pier.\nThe original pier was in place from 1936 until 2001. Today, its pilings and some of the old deck support remain, but it is fenced off to the public.\n\"This is a historical pier, people who grew up here or who raised kids here want a pier,\" Councilman Thomas Theodores said.\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Mike Langford, parks and recreation director for the city of Sausalito, stands on an old fishing pier on Wednesday, June 5, 2013, in Sausalito, Calif.

Here's what they had to say:\nIt left her cold\nUltimately, it was the key lime pie that broke me. For months I dealt with his food-related peculiarities   nightly dessert was only strawberry ice cream, only Haagen-Dazs, only eaten at room temperature, because he didn't like cold. But I hung in there because he had awesome friends who took turns hosting evenings of culinary magic with course after course of pure delight. And yet despite what the host offered, he invariably arrived carrying a raw chicken breast in a baggie that had to be grilled just for him.\nWhen an invitation arrived a week after I returned from Florida, toting a bag of fresh key limes, I was thrilled. Yes, of course I would bring the dessert! I spent a good hour squeezing every drop of precious juice from two dozen hard little green ping-pong balls, but the result was worth it. Oh, how everyone oohed and aahed, as they reached for a slice of my masterpiece. Except him.\nHe promptly rose from his chair, walked to the kitchen, and as we all looked on in horror, placed his perfectly chilled key lime pie in the microwave. Thirty seconds later both dessert and relationship were in ruins!\n  K. Virginia Price, San Rafael\nMeat-free year\nMy husband and I, happily married for 27 years, have always loved food, enjoying a wide variety. I believe the food chain is part of nature, however, the way we raise our livestock is inhumane and anything but natural. This has bothered me for a long time but while I was busy raising three young boys who love their steaks and burgers, I was able to push those thoughts to the back of my mind. Now that our youngest has left for college I can explore what feels right to me.\nI decided to not consume any mammals for one year, which makes sense to me as a mother. I started a food blog to record my progress and share recipes,www.goodmotherdiet.com . My husband is a willing participant, and guinea pig, in this venture, however he continues to eat big steaks, pork ribs and everything he has always eaten. The main difference is that together we do Meatless Monday, which are strictly vegetarian. My husband, like so many Americans, is on a carb-free craze, so we have also adopted Wheatless Wednesdays to explore menus that are mostly pescetarian and avoid carbs. It works for us.\n  Joyce Vandenberg Porter, Mill Valley\nPeanut butter, bye-bye\nI hate peanut butter.\nIt didn't start out that way. I once liked peanut butter cookies, Thai peanut butter sauces, peanut butter and banana waffles, experimenting with apricot or strawberry jam, whole wheat bread or raisin, crunchy style or smooth.\nThen I became a mom to three husky boys who sometimes brought two peanut butter sandwiches in their brown bags to school 200 days a year. I spread Skippy or Jiffy on at least 11,000 slices of bread.\nSomewhere around the 6,000 mark I started gagging at the smell, dreading sticking a knife into the dung colored paste each morning. So when my youngest left for college, I basket shot the plastic jar right into the garbage can.\nThree months later he came home for Thanksgiving. I woke up to find him ransacking through my new collection of dried fruits and gourmet crackers.\n\"Hey Mom, where's the peanut butter?\"\n\"I don't have any.\"\n\"No peanut butter? It's a staple!\"\nI laughed.\n\"No more,\" I answered, unapologetic.\nHis cool green eyes squinted. He shook his head, left the plain bread on a plate, and walked away.\nEmpty nests. Baby birds fly. With that, no need for nut by-products.\n  Victoria Rubini, San Rafael\nCruelty-free pair\nI have been vegan four years, for health, ethical and environmental reasons equally. During the first year and a half, I dated an omnivore. Aside from other red-flag issues, as you put it, which would have doomed the relationship anyway, the vast differences in our diet ultimately would have been a killer on its own.\nAs you mentioned, much of our social interaction centers around food, but it is also so much more than that. What we eat becomes part of us, as well as having a powerful affect on the place we live, and should be done in a fashion that is not only personally pleasing but respectful of animals, our bodies and our planet.\nAfter this relationship, I knew that I wanted to be with someone who understood this fully. And, luckily for me, I have found her. We have been together almost a year. Eating is not only a pleasure and an event for us, but has the added benefit of being cruelty-free, sustainable and health promoting.\nIn my opinion, vegans and omnivores just do not mix well in deeply personal relationships.\n  Jamie McCarthy, Gardiner, Maine\nUnsure future\nI have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for five years, since I was 16, and we've come to love each other more with each year. But recently, I have changed to an all-vegan lifestyle. We are both animal lovers and when I learned the truth about animal industries, it was a no-brainer. I was done with them for good.\nHe \"loves\" meat and milk, and refuses to learn about where his food is coming from. He says to me, \"I'm not the person doing the harm to them.\"\nI know with his love for animals, if he understood he would be just as devastated. With his refusal to learn and my newly found passion, the arguments are spiking quite fast. I hope that this will strengthen our relationship and maybe one day we can come to somewhat of an understanding.\nThis is a huge lifestyle change, coming from a small town surrounded with beer, meat and potatoes. It would be nice to have some support or another vegan companion. I can only hope that I find that with him.\n  Brittany Hounsell, Cedar, Mich.\nDietary concessions\nI am a vegetarian, and my fianc\u00c8 was a huge meat and fast food guy. We started out long distance so food wasn't a big deal. But when we moved in together we realized that we had major diet differences.\nI educated him on the benefits of a vegetarian diet, mostly through documentaries, and he decided to cut down his meat intake. We have a vegetarian kitchen and he'll eat meat when we go out to eat. It works well for us.\n  Liz Callahan, Phoenix\nA house divided\nWe are a house divided: one vegan, two vegetarians and two carnivores. The vegan recently became vegan and because he is the best cook, we eat a lot of vegan meals. We really miss the loss of butter and cheese in his cooking. People have cried over his blue cheese mac and cheese, it was just that good.\nHis Facebook posts are mainly about vegan things he thinks look delicious. They do not always get a lot of likes. In fact, his Thanksgiving-timed post about lentil loaf for Thanksgiving inspired an entire blog from me in response about how vegetables are not the star of Thanksgiving dinner and that vegetables are made to be creamed, drowned in butter and soaked in gravy as the Pilgrims intended.\nDinners out are a lot of compromise. The carnivores are thinking \"Burgers,\" the vegetarians are thinking \"Cheese\" and the vegan is thinking \"Tempeh.\" Regardless where we go, someone leaves with a tight smile and sad eyes while saying, \"Yep, that was great.\"\nI will say that even though we are divided about what we eat, we eat all together as many nights as we can and that is what is important.\n  Bill McMahon, Austin, Texas\nVicki Larson can be reached atvlarson@marinij.com ; follow her on Twitter at @OMGchronicles, fan her on Facebook at Vicki-Larson-OMG-Chronicles\nWELCOME TO MY KITCHEN\nIn this monthly series, From the Editor's Kitchen, we'll dish about all sorts of food-related things, from kids in restaurants to dealing with food allergies at dinner parties to cooking separate meals for picky eaters.

A 34-year-old former Healdsburg mayor, the personable McGuire is completing his first term on the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors.\nFor anyone thinking that the real decision about picking the next state senator was going to be made in the June 3 first-round election, here's a lesson on how politics is played in California. \nThe current 2nd Senate District represented by Noreen Evans, D-Santa Rosa, doesn't include Marin. After 2011's legislative redistricting, new boundaries for the 2nd District were crafted effective in 2014. The district now stretches from the Golden Gate to Oregon's state line.\nLast summer, Evans announced that she'll retire. It's no secret she's hoping for a judicial appointment.\nHer move presented a rare open Senate seat. The scramble was on.\nThe North Bay-North Coast Senate district is solidly blue. Any serious candidate needs to be a mainstream Democrat.\nThe maneuvering that started in September and just finished was the real contest.\nThe race began with McGuire and Chris Lehman, an Arcata political consultant, announcing their candidacies.\nMcGuire had the backing of the powerful Sonoma-Mendocino North Coast Labor Council. He also achieved the coveted endorsement of moderate Democratic Congressman Mike Thompson of Napa, the North Coast's most powerful politician.\nLehman was affiliated with state Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg. He was thought to have Sacramento support equal to McGuire's. That turned out to be wrong due in part to Evans' reluctance to back Lehman despite Steinberg's clear preference.\nAs McGuire and Lehman skirmished, two other Democrats, Santa Rosa freshman Councilwoman Erin Carlstrom and Novato Mayor Eric Lucan, tested the senatorial waters.\nCarlstrom quickly withdrew, shifting her effort to challenging Assemblyman Marc Levine, D-San Rafael, in the Marin-Central Sonoma 10th District.\nThe new year started with Lehman throwing in the towel and endorsing McGuire.\nLucan toured the North Coast and made a valiant try. Last week he quit, concluding that campaigning in the sprawling 2nd District was more than he could handle. He too endorsed McGuire.\nThe bottom line is that with the bulk of major endorsements and early financial commitments from public employee labor, everything broke for McGuire.\nOne by one the others pulled out, leaving the young Sonoma supervisor as the last Democrat standing. Effectively, the race was over.\nIn June and then again in November, McGuire, the prohibitive favorite, will face off against an unknown and unfunded conservative Republican, Santa Rosa's Lawrence Weisner. McGuire will win without breaking a sweat.\nWhy would McGuire give up almost guaranteed re-election to his $133,640-a-year-plus-pension post as a Sonoma County supervisor? He'll be turning that in for a state senator's $95,291 salary, with no pension, complete with an exhausting commute to Sacramento, all to serve as a junior member of California's dysfunctional Legislature.\nThe best guess is that McGuire is making the move to set himself up as Thompson's natural successor. Capping his career as a Congress member would make that sacrifice more than worthwhile.\nlll\nJUNE 3 marks the date for council elections in the city of Belvedere and the town of Ross. Filing for the unpaid posts opens on Feb. 10 and closes on March 7.\nIn Belvedere, the seats of two incumbents are expiring. Current mayor, Dr. Thomas Cromwell, will honor Belvedere's much-lauded informal two-term limit and retire. Recently appointed Councilman James Campbell will run for a full four-year term.\nLikewise Ross sees two incumbents finishing their current four-year terms. This year's mayor, Rupert Russell, has indicated that he is undecided, but it is unlikely he will run. Councilwoman Carla Small remains undecided about seeking re-election for a second term.\nColumnist Dick Spotswood of Mill Valley now shares his views on local politics twice weekly in the IJ.

Even those who haven't seen Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1987 play are likely to remember the 1989 film adaptation starring Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy. Now \"Miss Daisy\" comes to Marin Theatre Company, playing the company's smaller second stage, the 99-seat Lieberman Theatre. This one isn't an MTC production, however, but one that originated at Walnut Creek's small Diablo Actors' Ensemble in 2011. It's been revived twice since then, first at African-American Shakespeare Company (where costar L. Peter Callender is artistic director) in 2013 and now in a two-weekend Marin run. \nSo what's so special about this particular production that keeps it going and going? Well, a couple of things. One is that Diablo Actors' Ensemble lost its theater in Walnut Creek last spring, but the company lives on through the continued life of this one show even if its future is otherwise uncertain. But certainly no less important is that it features some superb performances from Callender as chauffeur Hoke Colburn and Ann Kendrick as his difficult longtime employer, Daisy Werthan. Timothy Beagley also solidly embodies the role of Daisy's ever-amiable son Boolie.\nThe play follows the driver and the driven's deepening relationship over 25 years, which is saying something because it starts when Miss Daisy becomes too infirm to drive at age 72. It takes place in Atlanta, Ga., from 1948 to 1973, and Clint Sides' versatile set captures various locations from Daisy's house to her son's office to the car without much need for moving scenery. (Even so, scene changes tend to run long in this show, presumably because of the costume changes.)\nA reliably excellent performer in many MTC productions, Callender was last seen at the theater in another play about a Southern Jewish family and the African-Americans working in their household. But last year's \"The Whipping Man\" was a very different sort of play, set right after the Civil War with a wounded Confederate soldier adjusting to life with his newly freed slaves.\nThe times are a-changing in the period covered in \"Miss Daisy\" as well, but as Hoke observes, \"they ain't changed all that much.\" The play is deliberately vague about how much of Daisy's initial refusal to accept a driver is because she resents needing one and how much is because he's African-American, but it's clearly a bit of both, and early on she's all too ready to think the worst of him. Even once they've been comfortable and chatty together for a long time, there are occasional reminders that this is still the segregated South and that Daisy doesn't really see Hoke as an equal.\nThe time is measured in traded-in cars and, eventually, the visible aging of the characters. The actors do a terrific job of changing their voice and posture over the course of the show, voices thinning and posture stooping in credible ways that are never overdone. At the same time, it's often hard to guess how much time has passed between scenes, especially early on. When Boolie says it's the first time he's heard his mother speak affectionately of Hoke, it's confusing because she and her chauffeur have seemingly had a friendly relationship for many years by then.\nIt's an odd play in that its many truncated scenes touch on many important topics   not subtly but bluntly   but then is content to bring them up and move on without exploring them. But that's just the way the play is structured. Each vignette lingers just long enough to get to the point of one aspect of the relationship and then gets out of there as quickly as possible.\nDAE artistic director Scott Fryer's staging is well paced and brings out the emotional resonance in each scene in effective but unobtrusive, abetted by Kevin Myrick's moody shifts of lighting and Danielle Hansen's judiciously minimal sound design. This production shows there's still a lot of life in this old chestnut when you have a cast strong enough to revive it.\nSam Hurwitt's theater blog, The Idiolect, is atwww.theidiolect.com .

The alleged payments were flagged as part of a routine audit by the California Public Employees' Retirement System.\nThe release states, \"The review found that Mr. Richards's salary in this period improperly included both a one-year retroactive Cost of Living Adjustment lump sum payment (for the period July 2009 to July 2010), and a subsequent COLA effective July 2010. There were no board approved changes to the general manager's salary in this period. The resulting combined excess salary payment was $15,718.\" \nThe district's current interim general manager, Greg Norby, said, \"It's our understanding that it occurred at Richards' direction. It was not a clerical error or something like that.\"\nCourt records show that throughout 2010, Richards was involved in divorce proceedings with his wife Tiffani, who petitioned to dissolve the marriage. Records show that in April 2010 the court ordered a garnishment of Richards' wages to provide $3,250 per month in spousal support to his wife. The divorce became final in March 2011.\nRichards, who was hired by the district in 2008, is accused of taking a $350,000 housing loan from the district that he never used for housing. He has been charged with nine felony counts including misappropriation of public funds, embezzlement and multiple counts of money laundering.\nMarin County District Attorney Ed Berberian, who is prosecuting the case himself, said he had been notified of the salary overpayment, and it could result in criminal charges.\nBut Berberian said, \"It's not part of this particular prosecution, and I'm not going to be addressing it directly in the evidence presentation at the preliminary hearing.\"\nA preliminary hearing is scheduled in Marin Superior Court before Judge Terrence Boren at 9 a.m. Monday. Berberian said the hearing may need to be rescheduled, however, if another ongoing trial takes longer than expected.\nNorby said the district will demand that Richards return the excess salary and intends to amend its civil lawsuit filed against Richards to include the $15,718 excess salary payment. The suit was filed last year seeking recovery of the home purchase loan. Norby said the district has also submitted a claim to its insurance carrier in hopes of recouping the loss.\nAsked if the district's finance director or other district employees should have been aware of the salary overpayment and should have reported it to the board, Norby said, \"That's a tough question. What this has shown is that the district was lacking in clear policies and standards for how the general manager's compensation changes were handled.\"\nNorby said he is submitting policy revisions to the district's board for its review next month to remedy this situation. The new procedure would mandate two board member signatures and a separate finance manager signature to exercise any compensation rate changes for the general manager.\nBoard member Frank Egger, however, said he wants more detail about how the overpayment occurred.\n\"The board needs a full accounting of how this came about,\" Egger said. \"We need to see the paper trail as to who authorized it, who paid it, who set the code for the payment.

Taylor State Park   a two-year construction job.\nFor years this winding 5.2-mile stretch of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard has been one of the worst roads in Marin   a terrible experience for drivers and bikers on their way to and from West Marin and our state and national seashore parks. Now those redwoods can be enjoyed safely by drivers and bikers without the concern of watching for cracked pavement hazards and the associated jolting ride.\nSo thank you voters and taxpayers for $7 million toward the $10 million spent on this major improvement in Marin's local road system.\nTo learn more about the expenditure plan, visit the Transportation Authority of Marin website and/or look for the upcoming annual report of the Oversight Committee now being printed.\nAllan Bortel, Tiburon, Chairperson, Citizens Oversight Committee on Transportation Measures A AND B\nNo strings attached\nThe IJ inaccurately reported Priority Development Areas as high-density housing plans. Unfortunately, the community is up in arms about plans that simply don't exist.\nThey are regional transportation funding mechanisms. Though there are housing numbers in the PDA literature to help cities that want to add housing figure out how to do so, our county doesn't tie housing to PDAs here and, so, there is no housing plan accompanying PDAs.\nCitizen Marin told Strawberry that by turning down the funding, residents will fight off the Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary's housing plans. But, since the seminary plans aren't connected in any way to the PDA, killing the PDA will get the neighborhood no closer to its actual goal.\nStrawberry's been begging the county for money for bike lanes, safer routes to school, and smoother commutes. PDA money is the best chance the county has to give this to them. But Citizen Marin has duped Strawberry into fighting against the very funding that it asked for.\nIf Strawberry rejects safer roads and smoother traffic, the money wouldn't go back into a general pot for them to compete over. Instead, it goes to San Rafael, or it goes back to the region, and seminary housing still gets built.\nUnless Strawberry sees through Citizen Marin's fog of misdirection and misinformation, it will lose out on the best chance it has had in a decade to improve its streets and quality of life.\nJim Geraghty, San Rafael\nDiversity of opinion needed\nAnyone who reads the IJ regularly is probably pretty familiar with Alan Barnett and his ultra-liberal viewpoints.\nHis Jan. 27 letter regarding the Marin City parade for Martin Luther King Day was extremely patronizing.\nAnd to the IJ editor, can we please have some new faces commenting instead of someone who beats the same drum all the time?\nA little diversity, please.\nGary F.Wanegar, Mill Valley", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 30"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "I DOUBT whether our readers noticed or questioned it, but the Marin IJ newsroom was keenly aware of the lack of photographs of Max Wade being sentenced in court last week.\nThe reason? Judge Kelly Simmons selected only one news outlet to take photos, and that was the Redwood Bark   the student newspaper at Redwood High School in Larkspur.\nJudge Simmons bypassed the Independent Journal and at least a half-dozen other Bay Area news organizations that had filed the required paperwork to take photos in court. Her decision came without explanation, and despite the Bark having missed the deadline for filing photo requests. \nNow, the Bark is a great student newspaper, and the IJ has a long history of supporting local high school journalists. In fact, our court reporter advised the Bark photographer on how to fill out the forms needed for access to court the day before the hearing   even suggesting he cite youth and inexperience for missing the deadline. (Apparently that was a good explanation. State court rules require paperwork to be filed at least five court days before the proceeding \"unless good cause is shown.\")\nBut cutting out the Marin IJ   which followed every twist in the sensational case that involved the daring theft of a celebrity's sports car and attempted murder   seems an odd choice. The Bark was granted exclusive rights; there wasn't a pool photography requirement as there often is in such cases.\nAnd just as we assisted the Redwood student with the paperwork, our own photographer would have been happy to work alongside him to offer technical tips that would have helped bring his photos up to professional standards. That wasn't possible, because the Bark student was the only photographer allowed in court.\nCalifornia law gives judges broad discretion over whether and when to allow cameras in the courtroom, but that doesn't mean we have to quietly accept their rulings.\nIn fact, Simmons made another ruling we disagreed with earlier in the trial.\nBack on Oct. 28, when celebrity chef Guy Fieri came to the courthouse to testify about the theft of his yellow Lamborghini, Judge Simmons without explanation not only banned cameras from the courtroom, as is her prerogative, but also from the public hallway outside of court.\nBailiffs ordered TV camera operators to leave and told all other media representatives not to take pictures in the hallway. Longtime courtroom observers couldn't recall a similar instance, and Simmons gave no reason for this unusual step.\nFieri is not exactly a shrinking violet. He's a high-profile TV personality on the Food Network, a best-selling cookbook author, game show host and restaurateur. If he had asked the court to bar cameras, that should have been made public and a hearing should have been held. As it happened, he held an impromptu press conference outside the Hall of Justice after his testimony.\nWhy does any of this matter?\nIt matters to us because we take seriously our role not only to cover the news and document the activities in the courts and other public venues, but also to be the public's eyes and ears. We are a Marin County watchdog; we have been for 153 years. Any decision that limits our ability to cover the news is a blow to the public's right to know   in this case, a limitation on public property outside of court and a restriction on professional photography at a significant moment in the prosecution of a major crime.\nTo be fair, Judge Simmons did grant the IJ photo access at times during the trial. But these other decisions raise questions about the seemingly arbitrary nature of cameras in Marin Superior Court; such decisions are left to individual judges on a case by case basis, with or without hearings or explanations.\nI've asked Judge Simmons if she would explain her decisions, but so far I've not received a response.\nRobert Sterling is the editor of the Marin Independent Journal.

A cheeky, 85-minute romp about coming of age amid the bodily fluids, vice raids and G-strings of the adult entertainment industry, the breezy one-woman show is making its world premiere through Feb. 16 at San Francisco's Z Below.\nDirected by Michael T. Weiss, this is a poignant, personal look at a notorious local legend that's become part of the colorful fabric of San Francisco history. If the show feels a little underdeveloped, there's no denying the operatic nature of the Mitchell family saga. \nThe 43-year-old mother of two certainly has a treasure trove of bizarre material to mine here, from her parents' Summer of Love-era romance to the tragedy of her uncle murdering her father in 1991. Accompanied by a San Francisco band, she regales us with what it was like to learn about the birds and the bees amid the swirl of booze and drugs that marked what Hunter S. Thompson dubbed \"the Carnegie Hall of public sex\" in America.\nIt's not an entirely tawdry tale of titillation. Indeed, Mitchell notes that before they became porn kings, the brothers, who grew up in Antioch, actually had aesthetic aspirations. \"Behind the Green Door,\" considered one of the earliest feature-length adult movies, which starred Marilyn Chambers, was arty enough to get them invited to the Cannes Film Festival. The 1972 picture earned the brothers $50 million and forever changed their fates. Big business soon won out over more artistic considerations. Her parents divorced. Cocaine played a starring role in her father's X-rated lifestyle.\nA witty and poised performer who writes vividly, Mitchell is at her most moving when she describes the way the family business shaped her childhood. She may not be as nimble an actor as she is a writer, but it's hard to resist her candor and vulnerability on stage.\nShe saw her first skin flick at age 4\u03a9. Torn between loving her daddy and feeling ashamed of the realm of stripper poles and pasties, she soon learned to hide who she was. Her Berkeley Montessori schoolteachers would have disdained her otherwise.\nHer father may have been an unashamed huckster, but she was always shy. The older she got, the more Mitchell gravitated to her mother's side of the family, the part that was more blue blood than blue movies. She escaped into summers on Cape Cod and the fantasy that she could get out from under the shadow of obscenity.\nWhile the solo show loses steam after the slaying of her father, when Mitchell descended into rage and depression, her pluck is quite endearing. She is also fast on her feet. At a recent performance, she ribbed two theatergoers who kept entering and exiting the theater in search of cocktails without losing her groove.\nStill, there are rough patches here. Mitchell can sing, but the musical interludes don't seem to flow from the narrative. She also doesn't etch her journey to healing with as much nuance as she does her tainted past.\nEventually, it seems, she came to cherish parts of her family lore. She still feels the pain of her story, but she also remembers Artie and Jim as anti-establishment entrepreneurs who were as proud of their Dust Bowl grifter roots as of their mob connections and mansions. Certainly, she inherited some of their flair for showmanship, the lust for the spotlight.\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: 'The Pornographer's Daughter' written and performed by Liberty Bradford Mitchell\nWhen: Through Feb. 16\nWhere: Z Below, 470 Florida St., San Francisco\nAdmission: $32\nInformation:www.zspace.org\n\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Liberty Bradford Mitchell tells the story of her dad, former Corte Madera resident Artie, and her uncle Jim, aka the Mitchell Brothers, in her one-woman show 'The Pornographer\u00ccs Daughter' at Z Below.

In the first round of funding from the new program several months ago, the supervisors sought to hand out $208,000, but the administration recommended $122,000. This time around, before funding requests were screened and pared down by the administration, individual supervisors urged spending this way: Katie Rice, $41,100; Kate Sears, $40,600; Susan Adams, $30,675; Steve Kinsey, $21,000, and Judy Arnold, $20,500.\nGrants from what critics have blistered as a \"slush fund\" were approved without comment under a program in which supervisors \"sponsor\" requests that are then winnowed by Hymel's staff. \nTop grants included Lifehouse Inc., a total of $17,175 for three projects improving facilities for the disabled; Sausalito Marin City School District, $10,000; Marin AIDS Project, $9,675 for syringe exchange project; San Anselmo, $8,000 to help pave The Alameda; MarinLink for Warm Wishes homeless project; Zen Foundation, for Green Gulch Farm creek program; Sunny Hills Services, $5,000 for youth development; San Rafael Public Education Foundation, $5,000; Schools Rule, $5,000; Marin City Network/Community Action Marin, $5,000; Conservation Corps North Bay, $5,000 for Marin Youth Ecology Corps program; and Boys and Girls Clubs, $5,000, Martin Luther King and STAR technology project.\nIn the first round of funding from the program, top grants included $10,000 each for Marin Symphony Association, the Marin County Fire Department's \"vial of life\" program, the Center for Volunteer and Nonprofit Leadership, and Conscious Kitchen; $7,500 for Buckelew Programs; $7,000 for Point Reyes Bird Observatory and $5,000 each for American Legion Post 179, Huckleberry Youth Programs and Bridge the Gap College Prep.\nThe new allocation system attempts to insulate individual supervisors from criticism that the program curries political favor. Although it reforms a plan in which supervisors spent as they pleased on pet projects, it has continued to draw concern from the civil grand jury, which has called for more accountability to eliminate the taint of political patronage it says engulfs the discretionary fund.\nThe jury has commended that priority be given to funding countywide projects, with a focus on emergency or one-time grants \"and not for ongoing recipient programs,\" and called for an annual report summarizing the number of applicants, broken down in categories, including those who were rejected.\nThe jury found that while county reform was a \"genuine effort to improve operations, increase transparency and accessibility, and lessen the influence of individual supervisors over grant distributions,\" the result still allowed them to \"direct grants to their favorite causes.\"\nThe county board last March, bowing to a number of jury recommendations, gave the program a facelift, tossing it to the county administrator while continuing to control who got grants. The program's budget was capped at $300,000 a year. Supervisors must \"sponsor\" all grant proposals under a system in which \"geographic equity\" will ensure each supervisorial district gets a fair share of funds.\nNadine Muller, forewoman of this year's grand jury, sat in the board audience but made no comment.\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

Plans call for six small homes.\nWhile some design, permit and procedural strings remain to be tied, \"This is a green light for the project for six modest homes,\" said Supervisor Katie Rice, adding the project was vastly improved in light of earlier proposals.\nSeveral neighbors seemed to agree, lauding Draper, known for his organic vegetable operation, as a good steward of the land.\n\"We're thrilled with what (county planners) have come up with,\" said Nancy Bennett.\nOthers opposed the project. Andrea Roussos wrote in a letter to the county board: \"It will absolutely hurt our neighborhood in terms of traffic, safety, runoff and trail access and it will hurt the county\" by setting a precedent under which \"development rights\" on nine acres will be \"banked,\" enabling the potential development of up to eight units elsewhere should the mechanics of such a \"density transfer\" program be worked out.\nThe subdivision site is in a valley bounded by the hills of Sleepy Hollow, San Anselmo and San Rafael. It is flanked by Sorich Ranch Park to the north and Mount Tamalpais Cemetery to the east.\nCounty planners concluded the latest plan would not have a significant impact on the environment and did not need detailed environmental review.\nDraper's Karuna Land LLC master plan calls for six 1,500-square-foot homes, including an affordable unit, and a 9.2-acre \"remainder lot\" dedicated for use on \"agriculture, recreation, a family memorial site and a meditation area.\"\nThe county board approved a master plan for the project, called for revision including efforts to protect a valley oak that graces one lot, and said Draper could fulfill an affordable housing obligation by providing an off-site unit   in which case development of just five homes will proceed in the subdivision.\nSupervisors rejected \"without prejudice\" a precise development plan and tentative map pending design and related revisions that must be completed as proposed by staff.\nThe Board of Supervisors, which once offered $950,000 to buy the land as open space, in 2009 rejected a plan for a two-lot land division, but following a lawsuit, a settlement agreement allowed for processing an alternative proposal.\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

Albee, who is an honorary member of the Baseball Writers Association of America and has a vote for the Baseball Hall of Fame, is the associate director of communications and media relations at Dominican University.\n \nIt was 15 years ago as I was interviewing Pete Carroll in his office at old Foxboro Stadium when I realized that his roots in Marin County run deeper than Ross Valley. \nHis ties to Marin pre-date not only the Vince Lombardi Trophy, but Vince Lombardi's heydays in Green Bay.\nThen coach of the New England Patriots, Carroll motioned me beside his desk and pointed at a large black-and-white portrait on the wall. It was a panoramic view of a big lot and open space with tons of trees and a mountain off in the distance, but I couldn't place it as easy as I could a Justin Bieber police mug shot.\nCarroll told me it was aerial photo of Greenbrae taken from the east looking west before the Bon Air Center was built in 1952. It was a photo of his hometown before a shopping center, high-rise condos and too many traffic lights appeared in the name of progress. It was a constant reminder of home   where their annual Turkey Bowl pick-up touch football game on Thanksgiving was born and how much fun life was as a kid   just a few feet away over his left shoulder as he sat at age 47 in his chair.\nAt that time, in December 1998, Carroll was on top of the world. His team had won the AFC East in his first year as the Patriots' coach and they were on the verge of making the playoffs again in a brutal division. A few days later, the Patriots rallied from a halftime deficit and shut out Steve Young and the 49ers' offense in the second half for a 24-21 victory, their fourth in their last five games.\nHowever, something was missing from Carroll's r\u00c8sum\u00c8. Something he longed for more than home.\nRespect.\nAs close as Carroll was to a photo of his hometown, he was not comfortable with the Patriots. For starters, he was owner Robert Kraft's second choice because Kraft wasn't then ready to hire Bill Belichick.\nCarroll was stereotyped as California cool, too hip for narrow-minded New England, a fun-loving, pop music-listening surfer dude who was too cute and too soft for the hard knocks of the NFL and the Boston media. He was much too rah-rah for the win-or-be-chewed-up pro game. They couldn't understand or appreciate that there was a method to his gladness.\nCarroll was criticized for being too enthusiastic, too positive, too nice. His way of coaching was unconventional and thus, critics assessed, forever doomed for failure in the NFL.\nThe Patriots' coach was the opposite of Bill Parcells. He was a stop-gap choice after Parcells lost a battle with ownership for more player-personnel control following the Pats' trip to the Super Bowl in 1996. Carroll fit into Massachusetts like a Yankees fan.\nMoreover, and perhaps more importantly, Carroll wasn't given personnel control either in attempting to draft and build the post-Parcells Patriots. He had an owner who wasn't as supportive or decisive as needed to be and Carroll lost the best player on his team, Curtis Martin, to free agency.\nSo Carroll was fired by the Patriots at the end of the 1999 season. Before the age of 50, he was a twice-fired NFL head coach even though he had only one losing season   his first with the New York Jets when his team was dubbed \"The Good Ship Lollipop\" by the New York press.\nThen came the 11-year itch. The one thing at the core of Carroll's spirit   and it has and should never be overlooked or underrated   is his fierce competitiveness. He loves to compete, whether it's for the Super Bowl or the Turkey Bowl, against the New York Giants or with the Redwood Junior Giants. He once elbowed a Jets assistant coach so hard during a pick-up basketball game at team headquarters that it opened a gash that required stitches to close.\nFor 11 years, Carroll privately harbored an obsession to be a head coach again in the NFL. He craved another chance to compete against the best football players and head coaches in the world. He wanted another shot to prove he could do it, yet the circumstances needed to be that he could do it his way. It had to be his personality and his philosophy moving forward.\nHe needed to scratch that itch. He sought respect.\nThat was hard to come by. Remember Carroll was the fourth choice to coach the USC Trojans and yet, as he led them to two national championships, he eyed another opportunity for the right fit to take him back to the NFL. The Seattle Seahawks gave it to him and, unlike the Jets and Patriots, they stuck with him.\nBack-to-back 7-9 seasons in Seattle were rewarded because he showed his way   his laugh-in-the-face-of-adversity coaching style   could indeed work. He could win and have fun at the same time.\nNow Carroll's quest for the Super Bowl takes him back to the very spot where he was first fired as a head coach. He is taking his Super Bowl team from the northwest and returning to the northeast   where most of his harsh critics from the past still reside   with a team he controlled and built and coached on his terms. He believed in the process   his way   all along and now he gets to showcase it on the biggest stage in all of sport.\nThe only shame of it is his proud parents aren't alive. Rita, who died in 2000, and Jim, who died a year later, lived together in Greenbrae for 45 years, long before Bon Air Center surrendered to development.\nWhen Pete became the Patriots coach, he bought them a satellite dish so they wouldn't have to go to the Flatiron in San Rafael to watch his team's games anymore. He arranged for his dad to sit in the press box at Candlestick Park to watch him bring the Patriots to play the 49ers in an exhibition game.\nThe kindness and generosity of Carroll extends beyond his family to lifelong friends, including his high school coach, the late Bob Troppmann whom Carroll phoned moments before his first BCS national title game with USC in the Orange Bowl to ask what call to make for the coin toss.\nOn the eve of the NFC championship game last week, Carroll called a friend in Marin when he heard his mother was ill. And after the NFC title game, he began calling friends to give them tickets to the Super Bowl.\nThey know Pete Carroll. They get Pete Carroll. He's about taking care of people, including his players, and he brings out the best in all of them. That's his deal. He's same guy who used to draw plays in the sand at Stinson Beach in the summer time who has remained the same guy today seeking the same thing, the one thing that has eluded him in the NFL, as clear as that black-and-white photo of Greenbrae.\nRespect.\nContact Dave Albee via email at www.dominican.edu\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll watches his team warm up at the start of NFL football practice Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2014, in East Rutherford, N.J.

Instead of a crossing arm and a machine distributing tickets, a license plate-based mobile application system will be employed to collect the fee. \nRiders who don't pay face a $45 fine from the Golden Gate Bridge District, which operates the ferry service from Larkspur to San Francisco.\nThe fee will be in effect from 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. weekdays. The fee will not be collected on weekends or on seven holidays. The district will also offer a $20 monthly parking pass. That would drop the fee to $1 a day. For more information visit:www.goldengate.org .\nThe district will use the \"Parkmobile\" mobile payment system. Customers register for free and pay via the Internet, a toll-free telephone service or by downloading a mobile app for the iPhone, Android, Windows or Blackberry smartphones. Parkmobile transactions are linked to the license plate number of the vehicle parking in the lot.\n\"The technology with Fastrak and Clipper is not aligned with what we are trying to do so we had to go to a smartphone app,\" said Mary Currie, bridge district spokeswoman, who spent part of Wednesday morning handing out information pamphlets to customers. \"There will be some confusion initially, but we think our regular customers will be ready to go Monday. It will be our infrequent users who may be unsure.\"\nThe district is also working on options for people who prefer to pay by cash.\nThe first-ever parking charge at the lot is expected to generate $400,000 a year for the cash-strapped district, which has a $142 million, five-year deficit. It is also looking at raising bridge tolls.\nFerry patrons are not exactly thrilled with the concept of having to pay for something that has been free since 1976, when the terminal opened.\n\"What are they going to think of next?\" said Dale Summer of Novato, who was waiting to hop on a ferry Wednesday morning. \"They are going to charge you for breathing one of these days. It's almost a joke, but it's not very funny. Everything you do they charge you for.\"\nLee Erby of Napa said he was resigned to paying the charge.\n\"I see why they are doing it,\" he said. \"What are you going to do? Either you park here or you don't.\"\nIn addition to implementing the fee as a way to generate revenue, bridge officials also want to encourage people to find other ways to the ferry terminal beyond parking at the lot. There are 1,800 spaces provided to ferry riders and all those are often filled by 8:30 a.m. weekdays. The district now runs a pilot shuttle   The Wave   out of the Ross Valley to the terminal. It has grown in popularity carrying about 150 people over 12 trips on busy days.\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: The Larkspur Ferry Terminal parking lot is full on Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2014, in Larkspur, Calif.

The company allowed Carl's Jr. to continue its operations until Chick-fil-A was ready to open its own restaurant.\nThe chicken chain came under fire in 2012 when its president, Dan Cathy, made comments about gay marriage.

The decision to play it in New Jersey this year has been heavily criticized by people who believe the championship game should not be impacted by harsh weather elements.\nDespite the fears, Mother Nature is expected to play nice when the game kicks off. At least, no snow or any other precipitation is in the forecast. But it will be cold   the forecast calls for a high of 40 degrees   and the stadium could very well be visited by that invisible element.\n\"The stadium notoriously has swirling winds,\" said Zac Fields, vice president of graphics and technology for Fox Sports.\nWith that in mind, producers at Fox Sports decided to add a graphic to their telecast that could depict the wind's strength and path as it blows through the stadium   and potentially redirects a few Peyton Manning passes.\n\"The question was posed, is there a better way to show the wind than just flags flying, \" Fields said. \"Is there a better way to show (the wind) and the path of it in real time?\"\nReplacing shots of flags ruffling in the wind with the wind graphic will give viewers a better understanding of how the wind moves through the stadium, potentially affecting the trajectory of the football when it is passed or kicked through the air.\n\"We can say that the wind, as it enters the stadium, is 20 mph,\" Fields said, \"but on the playing surface, as it circulates down, it's something totally different.\"\nFox Sports executives had been exploring the idea for a while, but they didn't make the decision to incorporate a wind simulation program into their broadcast until a month ago, Fields said. That left them little time to find a software company to provide what they're looking for, and for that company to produce it.\n\"It's been fast paced, blow and go,\" said Heath Houghton, an Autodesk product manager who worked with Fox Sports on producing the graphic for broadcast.\nIn all, it took about three weeks, from the time Autodesk was contacted to producing a finished product, Houghton said.\nAutodesk, which produces rendering software for various professional and educational uses, already had created a wind simulation program for engineering uses, such as determining wind drag on automobiles.\nHoughton said Autodesk's programmers had to re-write some code so that the simulator could be shown as an overlay of a camera shot, which will likely be an overview visual of the stadium.\nFields said the broadcast crew will get wind-speed readings from anemometers   devices that read wind speed and direction   fastened to the stadium's roof. The raw data from the anemometric readings will be inputted into the Autodesk program.\nHoughton, who is originally from Dallas, roots for the Dallas Cowboys, who are division rivals of the New York Giants   who play their home games at MetLife Stadium. He said he is familiar with the stadium's swirling winds from watching his Cowboys play in East Rutherford every year.\nAutodesk has done sports-related simulations before, Houghton said, but nothing on the scale of a broadcast of the world's most watched sporting event.\nSo does he hope for a windy day?\n\"Heck, yeah,\" Houghton said. \"I'm hoping there are 25-mph winds going across the stadium and affecting the game. It will make for an interesting story.\"\nAnd for many wind simulations.\nContact Laith Agha via email atlagha@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: This is a screen grab from a FOX Sports Youtube video showing 3-D wind simulation for Super Bowl XLVIII.

It is a rare cookbook that is both a useful collection of delicious recipes and an entertainingly delightful pleasure book rolled into one.\nThe recipes are quick and simple but yield surprisingly complex flavors. The chili crab recipe from Andy Harris left my family licking our fingers and sopping up the extra sauce with some freshly baked sourdough bread. The sweet, salty, spicy fusion of flavor will grace our dinner table frequently. Although most of the recipes are clear and precise, this one called for half a glass of water, which could throw off a novice cook. \nSybil Kapoor's papaya and lime salsa with lobster was delicious, but the habanero in the salsa overpowered the delicate sweetness of the lobster. Rather than changing the salsa I would recommend pairing it with a mild white fish to create an amazing fish taco.\nThe Hart brothers' mussel vinaigrette recipe takes only a few minutes to prepare and is a nice change from the garlic butter and white wine version I usually make. Unfortunately, the sauce remained predominately on the outside of the shells and did not reach the succulent mussel as much as my family would like. Deglazing the shells and coating the moist mussels in the resulting pan sauce turned this into another successful dish.\nThis is definitely a book I would recommend as a useful addition to your cookbook library or to be given as a gift to a treasured friend.\nRECIPES\nChili crab\nMakes 4 to 6 servings\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n4 cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped\n1 long fresh red chili, seeded and thinly sliced\n1 knob fresh ginger, peeled and grated\n2 medium-sized crabs, cleaned and chopped into large pieces\n1 tablespoon sambal oelek chili sauce\n1 tablespoon granulated sugar\n2 tablespoons soy sauce\nFreshly ground black pepper\n3 spring onions, finely chopped\n1 tablespoon cornflour\nTo serve:\nPlain boiled rice\nFresh coriander leaves\nHeat the oil in a large wok over a medium heat. Add the garlic, chili and ginger, and saut\u00c8 until softened and turning a golden color.\nAdd the pieces of crab and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring all the time, then add the chili sauce, sugar, soy sauce and half a glass of water. Season with freshly ground black pepper and continue to cook for 10 minutes, or until the crab shells become bright orange in color.\nFinally, add the spring onions and cornflour and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens. Serve immediately with plain boiled rice and a sprinkling or coriander leaves.\nTip: Use crab picks and crackers to get to the meat   a messy but very satisfying meal.\n  Recipe from Andy Harris\nPapaya and lima salsa with lobster\nMakes 4 servings\n1 papaya\n1 lime, juiced, plus 2 extra limes\n3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh coriander\nA pinch of finely diced, seeded habanero chili\nSea salt and freshly ground black pepper\n4 small boiled lobsters\n4 handfuls of mixed salad leaves\n2 tablespoons good extra virgin olive oil\nPeel your papaya with a sharp knife. Cut the fruit in half lengthways and scrape out the seeds. Cut the flesh into fine slices and put them into a bowl with lime juice and coriander. Resist eating there and then! Add the chili and season with salt and pepper.\nCut each boiled lobster torso in half, lengthways. Quickly toss the salad leaves in the olive oil. Divide the leaves between four plates, lay the lobster halves on top, and finish the spoonful of salsa and half a lime per plate. Serve immediately.\n  Recipe from Sybil Kapoor\nMussels vinaigrette\nMakes 4 servings\n1 kilogram (2 pounds 2 ounces) fresh mussels, cleaned\n25 milliliters (1 fluid ounce) extra-virgin olive oil\n1 tablespoon sherry vinegar\nA small handful of fresh flat leaf parsley, rough chopped\nA few small sprigs of fresh thyme\nSea salt and freshly ground black pepper\nPick over the mussels and discard any that are open and that don't close when tapped. Put a large heavy-based frying pan on a high heat. When the pan is piping hot and almost smoking, add the mussels with 25 milliliters (1 fluid ounce) of water. Cover with a tight fitting lid and cook for about 2 minutes, until the mussels have opened. Add the extra-virgin olive oil, sherry vinegar and herbs, season with salt and pepper, and toss together well in the pan.

I was aggravated because the photos and the story reminded me once again of the severity of these chronic abuses.\nThere actually are four, not three, user groups involved in the debate about sharing the trails. The groups are hikers, equestrians, \"responsible\" mountain bikers and \"rogue\" mountain bikers.\nThe rogue mountain bikers are those who frequently speed on the trails, endangering hikers and equestrians. They build illegal trails and jumps with no regard for the environment and the rules of the Open Space District. \nMany rogue mountain bikers derive a high from speeding and racing. They are addicted to riding over ramps and jumps at high speeds.\nLike true addicts they have no regard for others, only for their own gratification. When challenged or confronted they become enraged or abusive.\nI urge readers to visit the IJ's website and read the incredibly hostile and self-centered commentary that many bikers have posted at the end of the IJ story.\nSomething must change.\nAllowing mountain bikes on \"mixed-use trails and fire roads\" has led to our failed public policy. Mountain biking should be restricted to private lands and only to certain designated areas on public lands.\nViolators must be punished with confiscation of their bikes and stiff fines. Until such a policy is established and strictly enforced there will never be peace on the trails, or on these editorial pages.\nKenneth Kelzer, Novato\nLet the jumps remain\nCounty open space rangers found the jumps in Scotts Valley (\"Rogue trails, vandalism vex county park officials as plan is considered,\" Jan. 22) and contacted the Marin Independent Journal before they were going to meet with the public to announce changes to the county trail plan.\nOpen Space Director Linda Dahl chose to start this meeting, not by acknowledging that the unpopular plan was being modified, but by shaking her iron fist at bicyclists for building these jumps.\n\"It's a game of cat and mouse,\" the IJ story quotes district official Brian Sanford.\nI have ridden my bike for years past these dirt jumps. I remember seeing a neighborhood kid walking down the street in the middle of the day with his shovel. He readily confirmed he was going to work on the jumps.\nTwo scenarios are possible in this timely discovery.\nOne, the district is incredibly negligent in policing its land and, for upwards of 16 years, missed these jumps.\nOr, two, saner heads at the county knew this spot had been an eyesore in the past, knew the kids needed someplace to ride and chose to take a hands off approach.\nThen along came Dahl and the jumps were transformed into a political football.\nWhat a shame. I hope everyone takes a deep breath and keeps this small section of land open for the local kids to build and play on.\nLarry Nigro, Fairfax\nIgnoring the problem\nIf we can't beat them   it is better to join them.\nI have a long history of hiking wilderness trails and Marin has been my home for the past 18 years.\nI walk Mount Tamalpais three days a week and I see mountain bikers every day. Most of them are polite folks who are out there for exercise and some thrills.\nExtreme sports is another thing. Those attracted to those kinds of sports need places to get out their inner-drive and we are not acknowledging their youthful ambitions, which is causing them to build their own tracks and our willful lack of interest in their needs is damaging parts of our wilderness.\nMarin cannot afford to ignore the problem. Over time our wilderness areas are only going to get smaller and we need to be good and faithful stewards or we will lose what makes Marin County one of the most beautiful places on earth.\nJohn Thomas Ellis, Kentfield\nSAN DOMENICO\nBest for education?\nThere is no single school, nor any one educational approach that works for all students.\nFrom 1996 through most of 2009, I held various positions as a teacher, administrator and All School director at San Domenico School.\nSo it should be not be surprising that I read with great interest the recent articles, quotes and letters in the IJ about the upcoming switch to a coed approach in their high school   after 164 years of single-gender female education.\nI came to San Domenico in 1996 as a seasoned, 16-year, teacher and administrator. However, I was not experienced with single-gender education. Due to my experience in science and technology, I was selected to join a small team of teachers and administrators to visit and study some prominent East Coast schools, among them, Emma Willard and Miss Porter's (all- girl's schools) that had recently added new science and/or technology programs to their campuses.\nIt was my first opportunity to observe high school girls in single-gender classroom environments and I must say I became an instant convert. What follows is just my opinion, but I do have decades of classroom experience teaching science, math and technology.\nIn my opinion, boys will be boys whether they are in a single gender classroom or a coed one. Girls, however, have the opportunity, and many take advantage, to explore and experience new niches that would typically not be available in many if not most coed classrooms.\nCoed classrooms are more complex because there are more variables in the equation for success and therefore there are more challenges.\nGirls' single-gender education at the high school level, in particular, affords opportunity and development to women who may never experience it in a coed school.\nSan Domenico's ability to survive was a constant threat during my 13 years and ultimately my position was eliminated after the 2008 economic crash.\nIn a more perfect world, changes would be for improved educational reasons and not simply economic.\nBob Lewis, San Anselmo\nKeep girls-only tradition\nSan Domenico School has been an excellent institution and valued presence in Sleepy Hollow since it opened in the 1960s.\nThe vehicular traffic it engenders on Butterfield Road, however, has been an ever-increasing problem for our community.\nWhen the school revised its county master plan and significantly increased its enrollment in the 1990s, it caused an uproar within Sleepy Hollow because of that issue.\nThe school now employs daily school buses, but many run half-empty and that mitigation measure has been only partially successful. Adding more students will inevitably increase traffic.\nIt is revealing that the recent reports in the IJ about San Domenico's proposal to admit boys into its high school contain not a single interview or opinion from any Sleepy Hollow resident. It seems that the change really is about the money.\nIf grades nine through 12 become co-ed, San Domenico will be competing with one of the finest existing co-ed high schools anywhere: Marin Catholic, with its excellent academic and sports programs.\nThose who say that having teen-age boys interacting with teen-age girls will not affect the school are simply ignoring what adolescence is all about. Of course, it will have an effect. That's life.\nI have personally attended both co-ed and girls-only high schools. I wish the school well, but I regret that San Domenico plans to take its unique girls-only aspect away.\nConnie Berto, San Anselmo", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 29"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "A motorcyclist who crashed and died in San Rafael was on his way home from a Terra Linda restaurant after proposing to his girlfriend, she said Tuesday.\nTed Fuller, 43, was pronounced dead at about 7:45 p.m. Monday after crashing his Harley on Smith Ranch Road.

Jared Huffman, D-San Rafael. \"More so than last year, the president set a course and made it clear what he thinks needs to happen for the country, what he wants Congress to do and what he's willing to do with or without Congress. That's the right approach now.\"\nFor example, Obama pledged to issue an executive order raising the minimum wage for workers employed through new federal contracts to $10.10 an hour and urged members of Congress to support a proposed bill that would raise the federal minimum wage to the same level. \nPaul Cohen, chairman of the Democratic Central Committee of Marin, said, \"I was glad to hear the president talk about moving forward and taking action. So many people I talk to across the spectrum are really tired of government by gridlock.\"\nCohen said, \"I don't think he is proposing to exceed the constitutional limits of his power. He's just saying that the American public is fed up with gridlock and it's time to take action. His line that no one who works full-time should raise a family in poverty should resonate with everybody. It certainly resonated with me.\"\nMorgan Kelley of San Rafael, a member of the Marin Republican Party central committee, said Obama's tribute to Sgt. 1st Class Corey Remsburg, who was severely wounded in Afghanistan was \"a really beautiful moment.\"\n\"But the effect of that moment made it clear just how small the rest of the speech was,\" Kelley said. \"We heard a lot of same old, same old that has been ineffective in the past and probably won't go anywhere in the future. This was a lifeless, lame duck speech\"\nSashi McEntee of Mill Valley, a former chairwoman of the Marin County Republican Central Committee, said, \"He hasn't managed to follow through on any of his promises from last year. There were several rehashes of 2013 that cropped up. He's a lame duck at this point. I'm not terribly hopeful he is going to be able to accomplish any of these goals.\"\nTiburon investment adviser Dan Roberts, Huffman's Republican opponent in the 2012, didn't like Obama's request that Congress restore unemployment benefits to 1.6 million people whose benefits ran out last year.\n\"I'm concerned about this move to go back toward a dependent society,\" Roberts said.\nSome Democrats also were not impressed by the content of Obama's speech.\nWest Marin author and progressive activist Norman Solomon, said, \"The speech gave voice to faint populism, a far cry from the vigorous commitment we need for public investment to reduce economic inequity. There was plenty of stirring rhetoric but very little substance of proposals that can plausibly reverse the widening gap between the rich and the rest of us.\"\nPat Johnstone of San Anselmo, MoveOn's Marin County coordinator, said she was pleased by a number of the initiatives that Obama highlighted Tuesday: Iimmigration reform, restoring unemployment benefits to the long-term unemployed, universal pre-kindergarten education and reduction of student debt.\nBut Johnstone said she was worried by an off-hand remark that she took to signal Obama's support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, a free trade agreement currently being negotiated by nine countries.\n\"We're working hard at MoveOn to stop the fast-track of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has been referred to as North America Free Trade Agreement on steroids.\"\nAlison Howard, an assistant professor of political science at Dominican University of California in San Rafael, has co-authored a book on how presidents have used the annual State of the Union to communicate with the public, said that since the Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in 2011, Obama's success rate at getting Congress to act on legislative requests made in his State of Union address has plummeted. In 2013, he made 41 legislature requests and only two were enacted for a success rate of 4.9 percent, Howard said.\nWhile viewership of the State of the Union was down in 2013, Howard said it remains an important political event.\n\"It is the one time when you can have an audience with the Congress, with the public and speak to everyone. It's a moment that most politicians don't get.\"\nContact Richard Halstead via e-mail at rhalstead@marinij.com\n \n \n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Paul Cohen\nAlison Howard\nMorgan Kelley Frankie Frost\nPresident Barack Obama delivers the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress in the House Chamber at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday evening.

The unseen reality of pho is the hours spent skimming the broth, removing fat and impurities, until the broth is clear and light. At San Rafael's Yu Shang, the broth for the pho ga (chicken soup, $7.50 to $8.95) made the dish.\n\"It is a seven-hour soup,\" says Song Vo, who has owned Yu Shang with business partner Shao Shen for more than 30 years. \nWith a third room added after a recent expansion and into the space once occupied by Playa Azul Marisco Mexican Restaurant, Yu Shang had the space and the wherewithal to add Vietnamese cuisine to its Japanese sushi and Mandarin Chinese menu. Vo, who is from Vietnam, hired a Vietnamese chef to execute the dishes.\nThe menu features 11 styles of pho ($7.50 to $8.95), from rare steak and tendon to the special combo of steak, flank, brisket, tendon and tripe. Grilled meat and fish dishes are plentiful with rice plates ($9.95 to $12.95) and bowls of vermicelli ($8.50 to $9.25). The rest of the menu sticks to familiar fare like grilled pork spring rolls ($6.95) and cabbage chicken salad ($8.95).\nFresh shrimp spring rolls ($6.50), the scallion's green ends poking out like an exclamation point, were loaded with herbs, bean sprouts and tender shrimp.\n\"They are made to order,\" says Vo.\nHouse special crepes ($8.95), made only with potato flour and egg, had a crisp edge and a soft, eggy character. When the dish arrived at our table, Vo energetically demonstrated the proper method for composing the dish, placing cilantro and mint stems, morsels of crepe, pork slivers and bean sprouts onto a large lettuce leaf before encouraging me to roll it up and dip the wrap into a seasoned sauce before eating.\nA green papaya salad ($9.95), too, tasted of fresh herbs. Though the pork added to this dish was mushy and seemed out of place, mint and basil added bright notes to the crisp salad. The pork on the grilled pork and prawn vermicelli ($9.25) was nicely charred and not too sweet, the shrimp, sweet and fresh.\nThe hit of the night with the children at the table was the three-colored bean drink ($3.50). Designed as a dessert, the iced drink includes layers of red and mung beans, and coconut milk, all topped with vibrantly hued green gelatin. Chewy, creamy or bouncy, depending on the spoon's scoop, the drink was a success as much for its interactive abilities as for its cool color combinations.\nThe experience of dining at Yu Shang depends on which room you choose. The newest room feels food court raw, as if it has not yet settled into the hum and flow of its new family. Bright lighting and an all-glass front wall contribute to the shiny and new feeling. Move along into the sushi bar, where warm wood walls and hanging paper lanterns surround the U-shaped bar, and it feels cozy. The third room is more formal. Windows are trimmed with golden swags and mid-century chandeliers cast a cheery glow. Carved wooden pictures, imported from China, hang on papered walls and a large fish tank serves as a room divider. Vo works the rooms, greeting families, chatting with the children, bringing food.\nYu Shang's new Vietnamese menu adds a third culinary style to this long-running restaurant. The fresh flavors for which Vietnamese cuisine is recognized are evident in every dish. The portions are ample and designed for sharing.

Among Marin's eight water agencies, only the Coast Spring Water Co., which has eight wells serving 253 homes in Dillon Beach, has a supply deemed adequate.\nKumar spoke for all water officials at an animated water parley convened by the Board of Supervisors to weigh the severity of the drought, find out what water agencies plan to do about it, and generate publicity to prompt conservation measures at home.\nAfter three bone-dry years in 1974-77, the water district imposed rationing of 37 gallons a person, using a billing program that imposed stiff fees for excess use, and a similar program is now under review.\nWater officials are \"working around the clock,\" Kumar said, adding the community must \"step up to the conservation challenge\" and cut back on water use by 25 percent now. \"We have done it before, and we can do it again,\" the water chief said.\n\"We're all in this,\" agreed Supervisor Steve Kinsey, urging people \"not to panic, but to participate ... It's going to depend enormously on individual actions.\"\nSupervisor Susan Adams called for a review of managing growth and urged \"follow-up conversations ... to really come up with a vision\" on water policies, while Supervisor Kate Sears called for cooperation and creativity. Supervisor Judy Arnold said people are asking 'Why don't we have a drought plan?'\" and added that expanding storage seems inevitable.\nSupervisor Katie Rice sounded the most urgent call to arms.\n\"We need to be planning for the worst-case scenario,\" Rice declared, chiding an official who expressed concern about keeping key park landscaping alive. \"You should be contemplating letting your landscaping go,\" said Rice, whose mother, Pamela Lloyd, helped steer Marin through the 1976 drought as a member of the Marin Municipal board.\nA parade of residents among a crowd of about 100 weighed in at a session that attracted three television crews as well as radio and newspaper reporters. A forum designed for Marin businesses is being planned by the Marin Economic Forum and Dominican University, but no date has been set.\nSam Dolcini, head of the Marin County Farm Bureau, said ranchers face a water shortage as well as a lack of feed, with prices skyrocketing for forage, as the drought has killed West Marin's pastures. The situation is so bad that officials should consider saving the grass and weed cuttings from highway median mowing for use as cattle feed, he said. And Supervisor Kinsey called for a study of trucking recycled wastewater for use by Marin farmers, a suggestion that recalled a county water-hauling program in 1976.\nHousing advocate David Coury warned against rate structures which in effect force the poor to subsidize water used by those to water roses and fill swimming pools.\nRoss Valley Sanitary District Director Frank Egger urged rewarding those who recycle, including rebates for gray water and reclamation systems, and the board later approved joining Mill Valley and other agencies in a program promoting gray water systems.\nLuke Mazur of Belvedere said Kumar's presentation of familiar facts and figures missed the big picture because it failed to deal with increasing supply.\n\"What can be done to get more water?\" Mazur said. \"There is nothing in the plan (about) increasing supply.\"\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

Commissioner Pete Theran dissented.\nNeighbors Robert Mills and Anita Mills, as well as Jenee and Pascal DiFronzo, filed separate appeals of staff approval of the plan, balking at the bulk, size and mass of the project, impacts on privacy and community character, design and related matters.\nMark Friedman said efforts to accommodate the concerns of neighbors were extensive, noting the project began as a two-story structure and was repeatedly revised before it finally drew approval of the Kent Woodlands Property Owners Association.\n\"It has become too much to bear for us,\" he told the commission. \"We have been more than reasonable ... It is time for me and my family to begin building.\"\nFive or six residents rose to support the project, including realty agent Marilyn Rich, who said the Friedmans had \"gone through a million hoops\" in order to meet community concerns. \"How much power does a neighbor have?\" Rich asked the commission.\n\"I'm embarrassed for our community,\" she said. \"I'm embarrassed for Kent Woodlands. This has to come to an end.\"\nBut several contended that despite revisions the project remained objectionable.\n\"We're saying it is a little too big,\" Mills said. Among those questioning the project was Nancy Danielson, granddaughter of the community's namesake, William Kent.\nCommissioner Theran balked at design aspects and provided a lengthy explanation of why he believed the project failed to meet planning expectations.\n\"Does this house fit with the neighborhood? That's what I have trouble with,\" he said. \"I don't think it's right.\"\nBut other commissioners disagreed, saying that although a master bedroom could be shifted somewhat, the project made sense.\n\"I believe the home is appropriate for this lot,\" said Commissioner Don Dickenson. \"I'm impressed with the way this project has evolved.\"\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

We have about $360,000 in the bank,\" with pledged donations, public-private partnerships and in-kind services bringing the total to about $1.5 million, said theater board president Dietrich Stroeh. \"We're here hat in hand for the rest.\"\nWhile the presentation was strictly informational, the council members appeared receptive, with Mayor Eric Lucan thanking the crowd of more than 100 people filling the council chambers for their support, adding, \"Keep up the good work.\" \n\"The theater will be rebuilt as a community cultural center where live music, performing arts such as live theater and dance recitals and simulcast showings of live opera will be showcased,\" Stroeh said before airing a video.\n\"The design is going to the Design Review Board in March, so we will be able to complete the designs and hopefully start construction in March,\" Stroeh said. The design was created by Novato architect Dan Macdonald, a supporter of the theater.\nStroeh noted that more than 500 people have donated to the theater over the past two years.\n\"I've heard the roof is caved in and needs replacement?\" Councilwoman Pat Eklund asked Stroeh.\n\"The trusses need replacement. The rest of the structure is good,\" Stroeh said.\n\"In terms of ongoing operation, will there be a need for subsidies?\" asked Councilwoman Jeanne MacLeamy.\n\"Much is donations. We anticipate in the $3.5 million, six months of operating expenses,\" Stroeh said.\nAs if to underscore the degree of community support for the project, representatives of the Novato Women's Network gave a check for $10,000 to board member June Haugen after Stroeh's presentation, money raised during the group's annual Night of Gifting event Nov. 9.\nThe Novato Theater opened in 1947 on Grant Avenue, but closed amid competition from multiplexes in 1991. Several attempts to revive it have failed, including a bid in 1996 that left the city with $465,000 in mortgage payments, legal fees and other charges.\nIn 2004, the city acquired the theater from the old Novato Theater Restoration Committee, a group that bought it but failed to raise enough money. In 2005, the Downtown Novato Business Association led an $11,000 project to spruce up the fa\u00c1ade of the building and light its neon marquee.\nA year later, the city entered talks with developer Tallen and Keshen Holdings LLC to improve the theater, but negotiations collapsed in 2008.\nThe Novato City Council in 2011 sold the long-shuttered facility for $50,000 to the nonprofit Novato Theater group. The group received a $150,000 grant from the county in 2012.\n\"I'm here to support the theater. It's an amazing opportunity for us and our children,\" said Christine Greggor of Novato, who attended the Tuesday meeting.\nSonia Tanner, a Novato theater volunteer in charge of community outreach, said she was encouraged by the council members' reactions.\n\"I think they understand the long-term opportunity for our community presented by the theater,\" Tanner said. \"That was a wonderful donation from the Women's Network.

The family-run ferries have been taking people back and forth from Angel Island for decades, making the one-mile trek across Racoon Strait between Tiburon and the state park. \nBut there may be rough waters ahead for the small business.\nThe state Department of Parks and Recreation is considering opening up the service to bids and its process may open the door to more competition.\nThe state has long sought to increase visitation to the park. For many Bay Area residents, getting there is enough of a hurdle to dissuade them from visiting their park.\nIn 2011, 163,895 visitors took ferry rides to Angel Island. A large number   an annual average of more than 62,000 visitors   took the McDonogh family's Angel Island-Tiburon Ferry.\nMore than 100 people turned out to support the local ferry at the department's recent public meeting in Mill Valley.\nThey don't want any change that would make business tougher for the local ferry service.\nIn a David-versus-Goliath battle that would open the service to contractors with larger boats and more routes, the crowd was rooting for David.\nWe are too.\nWe do, however, think it's good business for the state to routinely take a fresh look at its options and operations. That includes its ledgers and opportunities.\nBut consideration also should be given to the Angel Island-Tiburon Ferry's long history with the island. The family has run the shuttle across the strait since the late 19th century.\nIn addition, it is the kind of water-borne business local officials have tried to encourage, not discourage. There has been talk, off and on, of a water taxi service that could take visitors between Tiburon and Sausalito.\nSupporters of the Angel Island-Tiburon Ferry packed a meeting to support the local institution as the state takes a fresh look at ferry operations. A 2012 state study concluded that the most cost-effective model would be a ferry service that includes stops at Angel Island as part of a multi-stop route.\nThat's not the model of the McDonoghs' operation. It is point to point, as it has been for years.\nFive generations of the McDonogh family have ferried passengers to what is now Angel Island State Park. In 2008, its ferry was relied on for getting 1,200 firefighters to battle a fire on the island.\nThe state is opening the door for more competition, if not changes that might make business tougher for a small business like the McDonoghs' operation.\nRevenues and service have to be part of the state's equation, but officials say the Angel Island-Tiburon Ferry's years of dependable service will also be counted.\nWe hope that's not a promise made at a Mill Valley forum but forgotten in a state business office in Sacramento.\nThe state is hoping to award 10-year contracts and seek bids from current and potential operators.\nFor those who turned out for the Mill Valley meeting, the decision is easy.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: In this IJ archive photo, an Angel Island Ferry takes off from Tiburon, Calif. on one of it's daily runs to Angel Island on May 5, 2003.

She was a senior citizen and had a bright smile on her face when she took a seat next to me. She let out a little groan when she learned the doctor was running late. I tried to comfort her by saying, \"I don't think he'll be too much longer.\" She smiled at me and began to talk.\nShe lived in Marin County since she was 8 years old. And yes, she certainly did see many changes in Marin in all that time. \nShe loved the weather here, especially the sun and air and the fog that rolls in on hot days.\nShe remembers when her father would, after dinner some evenings, take the family to Borden's ice cream parlor (near where the Whistlestop is now) to get one of those ice cream cones, dipped in chocolate. Her favorite was peach.\nShe remembered her first job as a soda clerk at age 16 on lower Fourth Street where there was a soda fountain and all the amenities.\nShe remembers the department stores, Penney's and Macy's next door to each other on Fourth Street.\nShe grew up in Fairfax and remembers Fairfax Grammar School, and Mr. Sisk giving her the \"E\" award for being the best well-rounded student.\nShe remembers when her sister died of a heart attack.\nShe remembers when it snowed in Fairfax in 1947 or '48.\nShe remembers her neighbor, a nice lady taking her to see \"Hamlet\" at the Rafael theater. And during their ride in her car, the lady explaining the story of Hamlet to her so she would be familiar with the story.\nShe remembers Romana, a tough girl in grammar school who would harass the other kids, and that she liked Nina and made her a friend.\nShe remembers when her mom, a housewife took a chance and one summer day made root beer. She put too much yeast in the mixture and in the middle of the night most of the bottles exploded. Her family thought it was war time with the noise.\nShe remembers clear hills with no large homes on them.\nShe remembers Marinship yard in Sausalito where they made ships for World War II.\nShe remembers her mom and dad telling her that before their marriage they would take the crooked little railroad up Mt.

She saved her tinfoil, knitted afghan squares and wrote letters saying how grateful people at home were for the armed forces efforts.\nShe remembers her mom, a wonderful baker, waiting for the cake to come out of the oven and all of mom's neighbors talking and laughing over the kitchen table.\nShe remembers the \"blackouts\" everyone had to adhere to during World War II, and the officer banging at their door to cover their windows and turn their lights out.\nShe remembers her dad buying and selling houses in Fairfax for $350 or $500. He would knock out a wall and fix what needed to be fixed and put it on the market. But if he heard a sad story from one of the buyers, he would want to help him get the house and he would lower the price. He really didn't make much money in the real estate business.\nI was utterly amazed at all that she had observed throughout the many years she lived here.\n\"What are you doing now to keep you out of trouble?\" I asked.\nShe laughed and said she was conducting groups on loss. Life is a series of losses and gains, she said.\n\"I give these groups to help people gather and talk it out.

He sold his Petaluma house, but pretty much everything else   his books and CDs, his TV, his pots and pans, his rugs, his tools, many of his clothes, his car   ended up in someone else's hands and home.\nHe wasn't sure why he was doing it at the time, but after a little more than a year of what he calls \"the great shedding of things,\" it became clear. \nCruickshank was headed to Uganda. With the Peace Corps. At age 56.\nIt wasn't because he was facing a divorce, or survived a life-threatening illness or lost his job or any other reason people typically reinvent themselves at midlife.\n\"I think it was just wanting more. Being a typical American I always want more of everything,\" the former longtime Marin resident says with a laugh. \"I'd been lucky in work and generally lucky in life. I'd gotten to do a lot of the things I wanted to do, and I really wanted to do something much different.\"\nAnd it indeed was different   in all the right ways. It wasn't one of the best things he'd ever done, it was\nthe best thing he'd ever done.\nIt was, he writes in \"Somehow: Living on Uganda Time\" (400 pages, Verflectin Media, $60), a gorgeous self-published coffee-table book in which he shares his poignant and often laugh-out-loud essays and photographs of his 2\u03a9 years there, \"the beginning of a love affair.\"\nThe longtime journalist, filmmaker, former Salon columnist and editor, and founder of the celebrated but now-defunct Fessenden Review will read from the book and talk about life in Uganda on Feb. 1 at Art by the Bay Weekend Gallery.\n\"There are few if any pictures in this book that don't evoke pleasure with a good long look,\" writes Owen Edwards, a friend and the former executive editor of American Photographer, in the book's forward. \"But the portraits Doug made of his fellow villagers are special \"... an admiring album of friends and the children of friends.\"\n\"This book not only makes you feel like you've been to Uganda, but that you have been there in a privileged, undeniably cool and entirely unforgettable way,\" writes best-selling author Elizabeth Berg.\nAlthough Cruickshank had traveled all over the world for pleasure and as a travel writer, he had never been to Africa let alone Uganda and barely knew anything about it except what he calls tragedy porn.\n\"I didn't know anymore about it than what most Americans know and here's what most Americans know   gorillas, Idi Amin, ebola. And now it's the anti-gay law,\" says Cruickshank, who helped grow a coffee cooperative of mostly women-owned farms in Kyarumba, a village in the Rwenzori Mountains, from August 2009 to April 2012.\nEverything we know about Africa is wrong, he says.\n\"All you get is the rapes, the murders, the wars. But what goes on most of the time is nothing   people getting their kids ready for school, they're getting some coffee or tea, they're working in the garden, they're fixing a roof. Their life is not a big tragedy and they don't see themselves as victims,\" he says.\nThey have a rich sense of community, they're resourceful and they make do with what they have. If you ask a Ugandan how things have been going lately, the response will be, \"Somehow,\" he says. Somehow, despite poverty, they survive. And they are happy   happier than Americans, he believes. He was warmly welcomed into their homes and lives.\nHe hadn't planned to take photographs or write   \"I was so burned out on writing\"   but he couldn't help himself. The country is stunning, or as he writes in the book, \"it always looks like something exciting is about to happen.\"\n\"It really has a Garden of Eden quality,\" he says.\nBut it was the people more than anything that fascinated him.\n\"They're a really sweet people and a lot of fun. They're really present, to use a Marin word. They're guileless, so if you're open to it you can make a connection quickly with people,\" he says.\nCruickshank, 61, who now lives in San Francisco with friends, has gone back several times to the village to visit with friends and follow up on some of the projects that proceeds from his book sales are helping to fund, including carpentry and tailoring workshops for orphans and latrines for the primary school.\nHis years in Uganda changed him in ways he's still discovering.\n\"I was already sort of a carpe diem person, but I would say that this amplified it and convinced me that it's definitely the right path,\" he says.\nVicki Larson can be reached atvlarson@marinij.com\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: \"Somehow: Living on Uganda Time\" by Douglas Cruickshank book signing and reading\nWhen: 3 p.m. Feb. 1\nWhere: Art by the Bay Weekend Gallery, 18856 Highway 1, Marshall\nAdmission: Free\nInformation: 663-8246, artbythebayweekendgallery.com\nMore: Buy the book atdouglascruickshank.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: The cover of Douglas Cruickshank's book 'Somehow: Living on Uganda Time,' a collection of essays and photographs from his years as a Peace Corps volunteer.

What can you do to protect yourself? \nConsider putting a \"security freeze\" on your credit file. A security freeze means that your credit file cannot be shared with potential creditors. A security freeze can help prevent identity theft since most businesses will not open credit accounts without first checking a consumer's credit file.\nThe cost to you is $10 to place a freeze with each of the three credit bureaus. That's a total of $30 to freeze your file. There is no charge to freeze credit files for victims of identity theft.\nShould you decide that you want to apply for credit while your file is frozen, you can lift the freeze temporarily at a cost of $10. For $10, you can have a credit bureau lift the freeze for any creditor you specify.\nIndividuals older than 65, with documented proof of age, can place an initial security freeze for free with all three credit bureaus. A temporary lifting of the freeze or replacing the freeze will be limited to $5 each time.\nMore information is available through the Marin County district attorney's consumer protection unit at 473-6495 or through its website atwww.co.marin.ca.us/da .\n  Marin County District Attorney", "author": "Marin Independent Journal", "title": "Consumer Tip: Block I.D. thieves with security freeze"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Boys overall\nScoring leaders\nPlayer           G           FG           PTS           AVG.\n1.

Only she used stronger words than that.\n\"She made me feel like I had done something wrong,\" says Liberty Bradford Mitchell, daughter of Artie Mitchell, who lived in Corte Madera. \"I didn't like to lie.\" Mitchell, who wound up studying performing arts in a New England prep school and at Cornish College in Seattle, is back in the Bay Area to promote her solo show, \"The Pornographer's Daughter,\" which is getting its world premiere through Feb. 16 at the Z Space performance space complex in San Francisco. \nShe didn't like to lie, but Mitchell also learned growing up that, as Oscar Wilde wrote in \"The Importance of Being,\" \"the truth is rarely pure and never simple.\" And that especially applied to life in the turbulent world of the Artie and Jim Mitchell, characterized by pornography, violence, drugs, booze, legal battles and fame.\nStory to tell\nLiberty Mitchell, now based in Los Angeles, knew fairly early on she had to write something about her father and his brother, stars of the burgeoning San Francisco porn scene of the 1970s and '80s. San Francisco had already hosted the Summer of Love and was ground zero for the Age of Aquarius, the anti-war movement, and just about everything else that would annoy the uptight \"I Like Ike\" generation.\nThe Mitchell Brothers were just a couple of ambitious kids from Antioch with movie cameras and film-class knowledge from San Francisco State and Diablo Valley College, interested in making it in the movie business. They saw big dollar signs in porn and set up business in San Francisco. They opened the O'Farrell Theatre, screened their movies, and produced \"Behind the Green Door,\" the first full-length porn movie ever made. And it received a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival.\nFor Jim and Artie Mitchell, the green behind the green door was cash, and lots of it, along with the trappings of fame in the fast lane   booze, drugs, women, crazy hours and the sort of rudderless rush to nowhere that happens when the likes of Hunter S. Thompson calls your joint \"the Carnegie Hall of Sex.\"\nThe Mitchell Brothers had to fight a constant barrage of obscenity charges   more than 200 cases, by one count   and were frequently suing those who'd made cheap copies of their porn movies. Still, says Liberty Mitchell, there was plenty of money for the brothers to expand their empire into a chain of theaters. They seemed to have a Teflon-esque talent of sliding away from serious trouble and attracting famous and influential friends.\n\"They were almost too successful; they were savvy businessmen and instead of pure art, their business became porn,\" says Liberty Mitchell.\nViolent end\nThe bubble finally burst in late February 1991, when an enraged Jim, unable to deal with his brother's spiraling alcoholism and mental instability that was endangering the business as well as his own health, drove to Artie's house in Corte Madera and shot him to death with a .22-caliber rifle.\n\"You can love someone and still kill them,\" says Liberty, 43. \"It's not pretty, but that reality has always existed. That's why they call it a crime of passion.\"\nLiberty was living in Seattle, where she attended college, at the time Jim's trial started. She testified that she had discussed her father's alcoholism with her uncle and told him she was \"really upset about Dad.\"\n'It's a huge story'\nLiberty, now \"amicably divorced\" with two children, has made a career in writing, including stints for television, and a job as an artist educator in Los Angeles. She says she has long had the story of being the pornographer's daughter in mind   first as a book, then a play, then a movie script, then, after discussing her life during a women's conference, one-woman show. The show is augmented by photos of the family and its endeavors and a soundtrack of 1960s-'80s songs performed live by San Francisco band the Fluffers.\n\"It's a huge story, the Mitchell Brothers story with so many stories,\" she says. \"That's why I chose to tell my story of growing up in a family, in the O'Farrell Theatre, San Francisco, in the '70s and early '80s, surviving my father's death and emerging as a fairly functional human being.\"\nShe admits being more empathetic toward her own parents after becoming a parent. And she sees a bit of irony that the era of porn and hedonism that flourished when she was growing up yielded to the emergence of the AIDS threat that was raging when she came of age.\n\"I grew up,\" she says, \"and now sex can kill you.\"\nif you go\nWhat: 'The Pornographer's Daughter' written and performed by Liberty Bradford Mitchell\nWhen: Through Feb. 16\nWhere: Z Below, 470 Florida St., San Francisco\nAdmission: $32\nInformation:www.pdtheplay.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: **FILE** Artie Mitchell of Corte Madera (left) and his brother Jim Mitchell in a file photo taken at the O'Farrell theater in San Francisco, December 1989.

It might be a bigger surprise if the court decides to hear the Point Reyes oyster farm's case. \nThe Lunnys' move comes on the heels of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling to not grant the family a rehearing. The Lunnys had asked the court to reconsider a three-judge panel's 2-1 decision to not second-guess the Interior Department's \"discretionary\" order not to renew the oyster farm's longstanding lease.\nTo many observers, the lease had run its course, a 40-year time line established by Congress to phase out the commercial operation and return that part of the Drakes Estero to wilderness. \nLunny, a West Marin rancher, took over the lease in 2005 and has turned the historic business into a popular gathering spot and one of the West Coast's primary sources of shucked oysters. The family has drawn support from restaurateurs, customers, local ranchers and Marin environmentalists who consider the oyster farm a success story for aquaculture.\nPoliticians such as U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Marin Supervisor Steve Kinsey have fought to save the oyster farm. Others have stayed out of the fight. \nThe state Department of Fish and Wildlife has issued conflicting opinions on the state's underlying rights to control the lease and has shown no interest in joining the battle.\nThe court of appeals said the department acted within its jurisdiction, but stayed away from whether that action was right or wrong. \n\"Drakes Bay's disagreement with the value judgments made by the secretary is not a legitimate basis on which to set aside the decision,\" the court ruled.\nThe ruling was a setback, but Lunny is not giving up his fight. He says the department has the legal leeway to extend his lease and its environmental process was flawed. His backers also have complained that the business was treated unfairly by the National Park Service, which advanced a public and political case for removing the business. It was an unseemly tactic, one that has ranchers in the park worried they may be next, despite promises otherwise.\nFeinstein, who has blasted the park service's ham-handed handling of the lease, pushed for giving the family a 10-year extension. \nSuch an extension, if not out of the question at this point, should not be renewable but should include bringing the rent up to today's market levels and requiring the oyster farm to provide environmental education programs.\nLunny was asking the court for a temporary injunction to allow him to continue his operation until his lawsuit directly contesting the Interior Department's order could be heard. Taking his request to the Supreme Court buys the oyster farm some time.\nThe farm will stay open until the court decides whether to consider the case.\nWhile its fate may be in legal limbo, there's no question the oyster farm has a lot of local support and the park service needs to mend fences with a community that has not been shy about showing its support for a local farming family. \n \n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Drakes Bay Oyster Company on Drakes Estero in the Point Reyes National Seashore, Calif. on Wednesday, November 21, 2012.(Special to the IJ/Jocelyn Knight)\nDrakes Bay Oyster Company employees return to the dock with a load of oysters on Drakes Estero in the Point Reyes National Seashore, Calif. on Wednesday, November 21, 2012.(Special to the IJ/Jocelyn Knight)\nKevin Lunny looks out at his workers processing oysters as his son Sean pushes a hand truck full of oysters at Drakes Bay Oyster company in Point Reyes National Seashore, Calif.

Lenders must document at least eight specific criteria, including income, assets, credit history and other debts, to make sure a borrower has a reasonable chance of repaying the loan.\n\"I see it (the regulations) as a good thing,\" said Bob Ravasio, an agent with Coldwell Banker. \"We're hearing people talk about a bubble forming in real estate once again. This is one more thing that will make it more difficult to keep that from happening.\"\nAs the real estate market bounced back in 2013, with the median price of a Marin home increasing as much as 26 percent in one month, many began to fear a bubble like the one that popped so disastrously five years ago. Unwise loans and lax lending standards were a major factor in that crash. \n\"I think borrowers may run into challenges if they have nontraditional sources of income. If they are self-employed or don't have W-2 (forms), they may find it challenging. They may have to provide more information than in years past,\" said Dustin Hobbs, a spokesman for the California Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\"But if you are a typical borrower with a typical profile I don't think you'll run into many problems,\" Hobbs said.\n\"Obviously, it's (the new rules) going to affect some buyers at the margins,\" Ravasio said. \"Instead of buying the three-bedroom two-bath in Mill Valley, a buyer might have to opt for a three-bedroom two-bath in San Anselmo and drive further to the city,\" Ravasio said. \"It's a question of buying within your means.\"\nAgreeing with Ravasio, \"The only people it's truly going to affect are the individuals who are trying to buy at the top end of what they can qualify for,\" said Gina Kemsley, a senior mortgage consultant with Larkspur-based Terra Mortgage Banking.\nThe bureau created guidelines for what it deems \"qualified mortgages.\" Such mortgages may not have a term longer than 30 years, cannot charge less than the full monthly interest, have no balloon payments and can't have fees and points that add up to more than 3 percent of the loan.\nAlso, in a qualified mortgage, a borrower can't spend more than 43 percent of monthly income on payments on his or her debts, including the new mortgage and credit card balances.\n\"I do have some clients whose ratios were over 43 percent and now we're going to have to lower their purchase price to make them meet the new requirements so they can meet the debt-to-income ratio,\" said Kemsley.\nOf course, should a buyer be adamant about buying a higher-priced home, it's going to be harder to qualify for a loan.\n\"If they do not scale back they will have a harder time getting a loan because they can't exceed 43 percent,\" said Melissa Richards, chief legal and risk officer for CMG Financial in San Ramon.\n\"The majority of buyers we've seen who are actually buying property in Marin right now anyway are extremely well-qualified,\" Ravasio said. The agent noted that he has not had any direct experience with the rules, which mostly went into effect Jan. 10. Ravasio said it's too early to know exactly what is going to happen.\nNone of the experts believed they would add to the paperwork involved in getting a loan.\n\"The paperwork requirements have been pretty onerous the whole time,\" said Rob Spinosa, a loan officer in Mill Valley with Residential Pacific Mortgage.\nThe new rules only ban one thing outright: No-doc or low-doc loans, which means loans made on the basis of an unsupported statement from the borrower, with no documentation (hence the \"doc\").\nAs with many of these rules, most lenders are already in compliance. \"Nobody has been doing these for years anyway,\" Kemsley said.\n\"What you are seeing today is much stricter loans that fall into much more conforming loan standards with substantial down payments and mortgage payments people can afford,\" Ravasio said. \"Lending has tightened up considerably already.\"\n\"For the most part, especially over the last six years, we've done a really good job of making high-quality loans. Borrowers are already held to high standards,\" Spinosa said.\n\"It (the new rules) will only make it harder for a few. At least that's what we see at the onset,\" said Spinosa, who said overall he agreed with Ravasio about the value of the regulations.\nHowever, \"I have a concern where protection tips toward prevention. That is my big concern going forward.\n\"If you have a jumbo investor who is making interest-only loans and we start to see people start filing lawsuits, things might change. The lender will have no legal defense in those cases. That's the six-million dollar question. What is going to happen? We don't know until the first one ends up in court,\" Spinosa said.\nThe loan officer was referring to the fact that if lenders do not document the eight criteria specified by the bureau, a homeowner filing a lawsuit could use this in a lawsuit.\nAlso, if lenders meet the guidelines for \"qualified mortgages,\" they will have strong protection from lawsuits by consumers. However, if they do not meet the criteria, they won't have such strong protection.\nIn response, \"We've heard from plenty of lenders they are going to do nonqualified mortgage lending. I've no doubt that qualified buyers regardless of where they are, including high-priced areas, will be able to find lending sources,\" Dobbs said.\nAt least one major lender agreed.\n\"While qualified mortgages provide benefits and will represent most of Wells Fargo's lending, we plan to originate non-QM loans to hold in our portfolio in order to serve strong borrowers excluded by the provisions of QM. Participation in the non-QM market will ensure these creditworthy borrowers will continue to have access to credit,\" said Chris Hammond, a spokesman for Wells Fargo & Co.\nRegardless, most of the experts seemed to feel the new regulations were a step in the right direction.\n\"Ultimately after what we have been through over the last several years, I think it is a good thing. The lenders are afraid of going through a mortgage meltdown again. They want to make sure that borrowers are not pushing it to the max,\" said Kemsley.\nContact Janis Mara via email atjmara@marinij.com .", "author": "By Janis Mara", "title": "New rules could make mortgages more elusive for some in Marin"}, {"relevance": [44.33333333333333], "text": "A bomb squad was called to Novato after a driver told authorities he was transporting a 4-foot-long cannon shell on Highway 101, police said. \nThe incident occurred around 3 p.m. Monday on southbound Highway 101 near Rancho Olompali State Park.

That player was Byron Barrientos and he has grown into the unquestioned senior leader of the wrestling team and a top MCAL wrestler.\nIt appears now that the cycle has started again and is already in mid-swing with sophomore Nicholas Gernhard.\nGernhard wrestles at 197 pounds and plays middle linebacker for the varsity football team. \n\"He works very hard and he's amazingly stoic,\" MC coach Chris Feder said. \"He is a leader by example. He's starting to put his mind with body.\n\"His skills are getting sharper and with that he's able to be more aggressive.

In four tournaments this year, Gernhard has won or placed in all of them and won his only league match this season as well.\nThere's no doubt that Gernhard has gotten to the point he is at so early in his career because of the leadership of Barrientos.\n\"I'd say Byron is our undistinguished leader,\" Gernhard said. \"There's a lot of characteristics I admire about him.

They both expect nothing but excellence.\"\nWhen Gernhard can find time he likes to play paint ball or go skiing, but between school work and sports, he doesn't have much time.\n\"It can be tough at times,\" Gernhard admitted. \"But it's always good to push yourself.\"\nWhen the idea of Gernhard following a similar path to Barrientos was mentioned, it was evident that Gernhard was flattered by the idea.\n\"I'd say that's fantastic to hear,\" Gernhard said. \"Byron's so good at wrestling and such a good leader. He's just such an admirable person.

The rider was pronounced dead under a tree in the center median, and the mangled motorcycle was several hundred feet up the street. \nAs neighbors gathered in the street, San Rafael police and firefighters blocked off both eastbound lanes and one westbound lane during the immediate investigation.\nJairo Tajiboy, who lives nearby, said he was riding in a truck on his way home and saw the motorcyclist go by at a high speed before crashing. The speed limit is 35 mph on the road.\nSeveral residents on nearby Smith Ranch Court reported hearing a revving sound and then an impact.\n\"This happens a lot on this road,\" said Shawna Hoch. \"My daughter's parked car was totaled (by a passing vehicle) a few months ago. It's a constant problem. You can hear them speeding by. It's terrifying.\"\nAuthorities were working to confirm the identity of the motorcyclist and notify his family.\nThe cause of the crash was under investigation, said San Rafael police Cpl. Alex Holm.\nThe incident is at least the third fatal crash on San Rafael city streets since last month. On Dec. 12, a pedestrian was struck by a car while crossing Civic Center Drive, and on Jan. 3 a pedestrian was struck by a dump truck near the downtown transit center.\nContact Gary Klien via email atgklien@marinij.com orhttps://twitter.com/GaryKlien", "author": "By Gary Klien", "title": "San Rafael motorcyclist dies in crash on Smith Ranch Road"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "Dominican University basketball players Salonika Quewon-Owens (women's team) and Devin Golston (men's team) were both named to the PacWest Final Five, selected for games played Jan. 20-26. \nQuewon-Owens, who has now been named to the Final Five three times, averaged 21.0 points, six rebounds, 4.5 steals and three assists in two home wins for the Penguins.

Since July 1 the district has recorded 3.79 inches of rain. The average for this time of year is 28.51 inches.\nWhile a downpour is not expected this week, if the moisture arrives it could signal the breakdown of a vast zone of high pressure in the atmosphere off the West Coast, nearly four miles high and 2,000 miles long.\nIn addition the moisture would begin to saturate hills so if more rain arrives it will more easily run off into county reservoirs.\nThe rain would come at a time when Marin reservoirs are getting dangerously close to a level that would require mandatory rationing later this year. Marin's residents are being asked to voluntarily cut back 25 percent of water use as of now.\nIf the district's watersheds do not receive a substantial amount of rain over the next few months, the amount of water stored in the reservoirs will be looked at April 1. At that point if there are less than 40,000 acre feet, a 25 percent mandatory program would be implemented, and higher water bills would be likely.\nThis week the district's reservoirs contained 42,762 acre feet and the reservoirs are at 54 percent of capacity. Typically at this time of year there are 64,770 acre feet and the reservoirs are at 81 percent of capacity. An acre foot can supply about three single-family homes with water for a year. There are 325,851 gallons in an acre foot.\nAny rain is cause for minor celebration, weather officials said, and more could follow next week.\n\"There could be something next week, but it's too early to say that for sure,\" National Weather Service forecaster Diana Henderson said. \"We are keeping an eye on it, but we do not want to get hopes up.\"\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com and Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .", "author": "By Mark Prado and Nels Johnson", "title": "Rain forecast for a dry Marin late Wednesday"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "On Jan. 28, 1962, ground was broken for the Terra Linda Community Recreation Center after voters approved a bond issue the year before.

The program puts homeless residents to work tidying city streets and connects them with services such as housing and mental health assistance.\nFor Gonzales, the team helped her secure a job within three months of joining. She'd been staying at the Mill Street Center shelter in San Rafael before joining the team and was able to get a ride from program employees to a job interview. \n\"The first interview I got the job,\" Gonzales said. \"It happened so fast.\"\nShe's now worked her way up to assistant manager at the Bay Area Discovery Museum's Bean Sprouts Cafe in Sausalito, where she enjoys being around children.\nAndrew Hening, the project manager spearheading the local program, said the team has been able to help a dozen people obtain jobs and attract 130 homeless people to its weekly meetings. He said the team has 26 members, with the average wait time to join about six weeks.\n\"We've definitely had interest from way more people than we projected,\" Hening said. \"We have about 10 or 11 people on the wait list consistently.\"\nAs of Jan. 10, team members in bright yellow T-shirts had volunteered 5,149 hours of their time to picking up cigarette butts, removing litter and sweeping Fourth Street and other downtown side streets. Many of the team members said they've received compliments and free food from local businesses. In addition, the workers receive $100 a week in gift cards for food, clothing, transportation and other essentials.\nSan Rafael businesses on the whole have had a positive response to the program.\nKrystal Whitaker, sales associate at Scandinavian Designs on Fourth Street, said she and her co-workers think the program is a positive one.\n\"We think it's great because there's definitely an issue with homelessness in downtown San Rafael,\" Whitaker said. \"They're actually being proactive in the community instead of just sitting.\"\nRajae Mazbar, co-owner of Aroma Cafe on Fourth Street, agreed.\n\"It looks like it's keeping them busy, which is nice,\" Mazbar said. \"I see them quite often and I actually play tennis at Albert Park and they clean over there as well.\"\nTaher Kia, owner of the Audio & Video Repair Center on B Street, said he loves it.\n\"Anything that actually helps these people and does something positive for the city is great,\" Kia said.\nNew team member John Hanahoe, 48, has been homeless for more than three months in San Rafael and was homeless for a year in Oakland. He said it's been satisfying to have people like the police chief and local business owners tell team members they're doing a good job.\n\"We're trying to prove we're just not an eyesore,\" Hanahoe said.\nKen Yatta Anderson, 34, was briefly homeless when he moved from Richmond to San Rafael after watching his family members die from drug overdoses and violence. In his four months on the team, he's been able to find seasonal jobs to make ends meet.\n\"Without them, I don't know where I'd be at,\" he said. \"I'm ready for the work field.\"\nMichaelangelo Villagomez, 57, has been with the team since September. A precariously housed carpenter, Villagomez said he enjoys being a mentor to the other team members who are trying to quit their dependence on drugs or alcohol.\n\"They're getting a lot better, let me tell you, they're cleaning up their acts. I appreciate that and they appreciate me because I'm an ex-alcoholic,\" Villagomez said.\nAfter more than two months working on the team, John Bahel, 56, is headed for a sober living house from the Mill Street Center shelter. He said the team has helped him gain work experience and helped him find housing.\n\"Being on the streets, it's really hard to stay sober,\" Bahel said.\nWhile the team seems to be making strides, it'll ultimately be up to the City Council to decide whether to renew its one-year contract with the Downtown Streets Team.\nThe team's efforts are being funded with $25,000 from the county, $50,000 from the Marin Community Foundation, $100,000 from Marin General Hospital, $50,000 from Kaiser Permanente and $47,000 from the city.\nThe funding has been used to create more beds at the Vine Detox Center in San Rafael, where people can receive alcohol and drug detoxification. Instead of sending intoxicated homeless people to the jail or hospital, the police are taking more people to the detox center. This will save the hospitals and county money, allowing them to funnel through funding for the streets team.\nMayor Gary Phillips, who spearheaded the effort to bring the program to the city, said he has yet to approach the organizations currently funding the team to see if they'd pitch in again. He said he's confident the program will be able to continue, but the team needs to secure contracts with local businesses and events like it does in Palo Alto to make itself sustainable.\n\"I fully expect the Downtown Streets Team to generate their own funding sources to some degree,\" Phillips said. \"The city will contribute again if it's as successful as it seems to be at this point in time.\"\nHening said the team has secured a contract with the downtown farmers market for 2014 and has worked community events put on by the Downtown San Rafael Business Improvement District.\n\"People have been super vocal and positive about it,\" Hening said.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

The bank finished the year with $1.3 billion in gross loans and $1.6 billion in deposits.\nBank of Alameda was Bank of Marin's second acquisition in the last three years.

Those sites are now zoned with an affordable housing \"overlay.\"\nAlthough the newspaper accounts recycled some of the old saws about residents crying foul and expecting crime, noise and traffic from affordable housing, the high point was omitted. \nCity planners Hans Grunt  and Elizabeth Dunn's arguments about a range of 20-23 units per acre being reasonable for our affordable housing base density, despite housing law's default density for Novato of 30 units per acre, were agreed to by the state.\nThese two planners shouldered major responsibility in writing the housing element.\nThe state commended Hans and Elizabeth as well as Assistant City Attorney Veronica Nebbs in its approval letter and Novatoans should thank them for their service.\nThis, by far, is the most significant recent achievement of Novato's planning department.\nNovato achieved this while the county did not.  \nAlthough Supervisor Judy Arnold appeared to be aware of Novato's achievement, she erroneously credited it to two City Council members and the Housing Working Group.  \nThe council's addition of a new affordable housing site north of the North Redwood Corridor, unvetted by the Housing Working Group, understandably stirred a hornet's nest of opposition.\nAlso, the last-minute addition of zoning for an emergency shelter near Bel Marin Keys did not really allow time for community/neighborhood feedback. \nThis is one area in the process the city could improve upon in order to promote citizen trust and cooperation for our next housing element. \nThe council kept four sites and threw out four recommended by the Housing Working Group.\nAnother high point of the 2007-14 housing element is that our planning department and the state shifted the emphasis from 100 percent affordable housing sites to 20 percent inclusive affordable housing requirements for all housing developments in the city in order to disperse the affordable housing rather than concentrating it.\nUnless genuine local volunteer groups like the Novato Community Alliance, the San Marin Compatible Housing Coalition, Novato Homeowners Association, the Clausen Court, Bel Marin Keys and Partidge Knolls neighborhood associations, Novato Neighbors, and others continue to organize, the outside networks will move in again to try to regain control.\nPlease continue to support us as we turn this year toward a general emphasis on good local government and particularly the issue of transparency.  \nWe have a long way to go on transparency.", "author": "Pam Drew", "title": "Marin Voice: Local activism fueled changes to Novato housing element"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "The Drakes Bay Oyster Co. has been granted a legal stay to allow it to continue operations over the next 90 days while it prepares its case for the U.S. Supreme Court.\nEarlier this month the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to re-hear the Drakes Bay case in which owner Kevin Lunny sought an injunction to keep his operation open.

Here's why:\nMarin's Open Space District was created a generation ago, when there were 50 percent fewer people in the county and those people spent less time hiking or riding. \nToday, we have user groups that didn't exist back then; like mountain bikers and dog walkers. All of this means far more impact (damage) to the habitat and environment. \nWe, the citizens of Marin, have an obligation to ourselves, our children and to generations to come to insure our open space lands remain vibrant and healthy.\nThe plan was developed over several years and the process included public meetings to gather input and suggestions. \nPreliminary plans were explained as the document evolved over time. There were no big surprises from one meeting to the next; district staff were transparent and responsive.\nI was shocked to learn the scope of the district's lands. If one hiked from a different trailhead every weekend, it would take over six years to hit them all. \nThere are 34 separate preserves.\nI ask that those who take issue with \"their trail\" step back a minute and consider the larger picture. For each of us, there are 250,000 other residents who may want to enjoy that same trail.\nThe plan is in the home stretch. As modified, it strikes a balance between necessary protections and reasonable access for all user groups. \nIt should be adopted.\nCurt Kruger, Novato\nRice should retire   now\nI attended the Jan. 15 meeting on my property owners' association, when Supervisor Katie Rice addressed our group.\nWe questioned her about Corte Madera's WinCup development, the proposed Larkspur Landing development, Grady Ranch, Marinwood Plaza, Strawberry and all future such developments across Marin.\nRelative to WinCup, she stated, \"We did not see that coming,\" and \"It was outside of my jurisdiction\" and that it was residents' fault for not being vigilant. She said we didn't need to worry about Larkspur Landing because nothing has been approved yet.\nRice, however, failed to mention that she sits on the Association of Bay Area Governments board, one of the drivers of Plan Bay Area, and voted to support development plans.\nWe stated that such developments will permanently alter Marin's rapidly fading suburban character. When asked for solutions to the current traffic gridlock, which will only worsen with increased development, fortunately, she proposed a truly innovative and breathtakingly fresh solution: People should only drive when they really need to.\nSo, to comply with this  refreshing approach to alleviating traffic congestion, from now on, I will only shop for groceries at 3 a.m.  At my request, I'm sure my library, pet store and the like will be open from 2 to 5 a.m.\nIf this is the best that she can do, then it's time for her to leave office before she does any more harm.\nBasia Crane, Kentfield \nNo oysters, no humans\nIf indeed the Drakes Bay oyster farm is closed by the government and returned to wilderness, a  new dilemma may ensue.

At least that's what the adage says.\nWhether that's the intent of county supervisors, or they want to provide local talent, young and old, a venue in which to perform, the board's decision to start its meetings with a little music is a good one. \nMusic offers a break, a respite from the political tensions that are not uncommon at board meetings.\nMusic can offer a reminder that we can share time enjoying a performance even if we don't share opinions.\nA brief performance at the beginning of the meeting might even get the supervisors to start on time.\nSupervisors seized on the idea after an impromptu performance before testy public hearing on the county's affordable housing plan in September. Saxophonist Richard Howell set the tone, so to speak, with a performance before an overflow crowd.\nSome observers say his performance helped focus the meeting. Others say it's a waste of time, a way for the board to prolong its day-time meetings for a busy public.\nSupervisors say they will invite a local musician or group to perform at the start of its meetings once a month.\n\"I thought it would be a fun thing to keep doing,\" said Supervisor Kate Sears. \"Music is a wonderful way to start any meeting.\"\nWe should have time for a once-a-month small dose of local talent.

You hear it now and then in regard to San Rafael Councilman Damon Connolly's quest for a seat on the Board of Supervisors or Novato's Eric Lucan in his recent brief try for the state Senate.\nThe criticism is off the mark, because it overlooks the very nature of service on a city or town council. \nThe ultimate mark of successful council members is the condition of their community, not a grandiose signature project.\nServing as a council member is inherently a collaborative process. A lone wolf doesn't get far.\nA council member who is part of a voting majority on a city council that has its act together is a success.\nTo judge a council member's performance, ask:\n* Does the city fiscally operate within its means?\n* Is the infrastructure, including parks, library and roads, in first-class shape?\n* Does the planning process reflect the desires of the community?\n* Do residents share a vision of the town's future or are they divided by bitter factions?\n* Does the city employ a top-rated, well-regarded city manager and senior staff who are responsive to popular concerns?\n* Are the city's pensions and retiree health insurance liabilities in better condition than in neighboring communities?\nNo community is perfect. Yet, if the answers to most of these questions are in the affirmative, then the definition of a well-run town is met and kudos are due to the town's council.\nRecall some of Marin's outstanding council members during the past 20 years: Kathleen Foote in Mill Valley, San Rafael's Dottie Breiner, San Anselmo's Paul Chignell, Fairfax's Johanna Wilmann, Corte Madera's Jana Haehl, Amy Belser in Sausalito or Novato's Ernie Gray.\nMost observers record them as highly accomplished, but no single project serves as a monument to their job professionally performed.\nThat's because their true epitaph is a town well run.\nBeing part of a council team that fosters an efficiently operated city or town is a first-rate reference for any council member trying to move up the political ladder.\nCouncil members are essentially community volunteers, not professional politicians.\nSo long as they don't let their post go to their head or shame themselves by taking greedy perks like lifetime health-care insurance or retirement benefits, Marin's city and town council members deserve the title \"honorable.\"\nlll\nTHERE are 11 incorporated municipalities in Marin. Five of these   Fairfax, San Anselmo, Ross, Corte Madera and Tiburon   style themselves as \"towns.\" The other six are called \"cities.\"\nSo what's the difference between a \"town\" and a \"city?\"\nThe easy answer is that there is no distinction.\nUnder California law the terms are interchangeable. A town isn't necessarily smaller than a city. Just look at the urban beehive that's the city of Belvedere, one of Marin's oldest incorporated communities.\nIt's next door to the hamlet that's the town of Tiburon.\nThe latter, of course, is much larger than the former.\nThe switch mostly happened in the 1970s, when some communities opted to label themselves \"towns\" to highlight their treasured \"small-town\" character.\nBelvedere, Mill Valley, Sausalito and Larkspur were older communities confident their identities would withstand the word \"city\" without anyone getting confused.\nColumnist Dick Spotswood of Mill Valley now shares his views on local politics twice weekly in the IJ.

Walk up Glen Fire Road. The uphill grade starts immediately. To your left is Warner Canyon, a deep, heavily wooded canyon that separates Blithedale Ridge and Corte Madera Ridge.\nVeer to the left where the fire road splits, and follow Warner Canyon Fire Road. This nearly level fire road provides easy walking through a thick forest of redwood, Douglas fir, bay and huckleberry. Usually, the first wildflowers of the season, such as milkmaids, are beginning to bloom in January but on my recent hike I did not see any.\nAt the place where the fire road makes a sharp downhill turn to the left, note the wooden steps on the right that mark the Maytag Trail because you'll come back to this trail after the detour into Warner Canyon.\nTo explore the far reaches of this deep ravine, continue downhill and turn left onto the Warner Canyon Trail. Redwoods are thick along the path. The trail dead-ends at a sharp canyon wall. During normal rainy seasons, there's a waterfall tumbling down the rocky slope into the ravine and a small stream flows through Warner Canyon. It was dry during my visit, but it may appear if Marin receives a significant rainstorm.\nRetrace your steps back to the wood steps, go up them and continue up the Maytag Trail. Follow the switchbacks as the path winds through groves of young redwoods en route to the top of Blithedale Ridge.\nTurn right onto the ridge-top fire road, and enjoy views of homes in Mill Valley and Mount Tamalpais' East Peak. This portion of the Blithedale Ridge Fire Road consists of short steep sections as the road roller coasters uphill and downhill several times before leveling out.\nVeer to the right where the fire road splits. As you round the upper end of Warner Canyon, the view includes Richardson Bay, Tiburon, Angel Island, Alcatraz, San Francisco Bay and the Oakland Bay Bridge.\nAt the intersection of fire roads, turn right onto Glen Fire Road and follow it downhill to complete the loop.\nTo reach the Glen Fire Road, leave Highway 101 at the Mill Valley/Tiburon exit. Follow East Blithedale Avenue, turn right on Carmelita, right onto Buena Vista, which becomes Glen Drive.\nTacy Dunham is the author of several trail guide books.

RITA SCHOOL in Fairfax opened its doors in 1957. Enrollment at the school peaked in the early 1970s with nearly 300 students, a time that many consider to be the heyday of Catholic education. \nBut as the various religious orders began to withdraw from education in the late 1970s and 1980s, tuition rates increased, and enrollment began to decline at many schools nationwide. Decades of similar enrollment struggles at St. Rita School culminated in the near-closure of the school at the end of the 2012-13 school year.\nA campaign to \"Save St. Rita\" resulted in a generous outpouring of financial support which gave the school new life and allowed its doors to remain open.\nAs all Catholic schools across the country have done, St. Rita was forced to examine itself carefully and decide upon a new direction that would attract more students without sacrificing its Catholic identity.\nThis self-examination led to the decision to adopt two new programs for the 2014-15 school year: The International Baccalaureate Primary Years Program and the Gateway to Technology Middle School Engineering Program.\nIn addition, the school will begin offering an after-school Mandarin program during the current school year.\nThe International Baccalaureate (IB) Program was created at the International School of Geneva in the late 1960s. What started as a single program for internationally mobile students preparing for university, has today grown into three programs for students aged 3 to 19.\nSt. Rita School will implement the Primary Years Program which is designed for students in Kindergarten to grade five.\nThe IB's stated mission is to \"develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.\"\nThe Middle School Engineering Program for students in grades 6 to 8 is similarly an inquiry-based program that features a project-based curriculum designed to challenge and engage the natural curiosity and imagination of middle school students.\nMiddle schools and high schools nationwide are embracing such STEM programs with the intent of highlighting the importance of science, technology, engineering and math, particularly given the mediocre performance of American students on international science and math exams.\nThe Common Core Standards, which have been adopted by most states nationwide, also attempts to redirect the instruction in the classroom to further develop students' problem-solving skills and ability to think critically.\nIn many ways, education in the United States is attempting to play catch-up with the needs of 21st century employers who are demanding workers who are critical thinkers and problem solvers, and able to think outside of the proverbial box.\nSt. Rita School is committed to being at the forefront of this movement to better prepare students for the realities of the global-community of the 21st century.\nJohn Black is principal at St. Rita School in Fairfax.

In fact, it is audibly quite dynamic with banging body checks rattling the boards, skates grinding through ice and booming shots echoing off steel goal posts.\nIf silent bliss, however, is more your cup of tea then underwater hockey might be the sport you've been looking for.\nFor San Rafael resident Jason Zvanut, a 12-year veteran of underwater hockey, silence is golden. \n\"I work in a fast-paced environment,\" said Zvanut, who consults and works on various projects for his own solar industry company. \"One of the best ways to put everything out of my mind and just focus on one thing   the puck   is by playing underwater hockey because it's really the only thing you can do when you are playing.\"\nFar from a mainstream sport in this country, Zvanut is doing his best to give the game some exposure by creating an underwater hockey class set to begin Wednesday at College of Marin.\nUnderwater hockey is a globally-played sport in which two six-player co-ed teams, equipped with snorkels, fins and masks compete to maneuver a puck across the bottom of a swimming pool using 10-inch hooked sticks into the oppositions' goal.\n\"It's an absolute blast to play and it's great exercise,\" Zvanut said. \"It's a very anaerobic type of exercise, but at the same time low impact.\"\nZvanut, 42, kind of stumbled across the sport in 2001. He said he had just quit smoking and started an exercise regime of underwater laps in the YMCA pool.\n\"The guy at the front desk at the YMCA saw me doing this everyday and when a woman came to him and asked about potential underwater hockey players, he told her about me,\" Zvanut said. \"She came to me and I went and tried it out. I loved it right away.\"\nZvanut, who has been a certified scuba diving teacher since 2001, obviously was already comfortable in an underwater environment. But he insists such a background is not a prerequisite for enjoying the sport.\n\"In my experience, people who come and play continue to play,\" he said. \"And a lot of times it's people just learning to use a snorkel for the first time.\"\nNicolas Paris, a native of France and a teammate of Zvanut's on the San Francisco Sea Lions underwater hockey team, said he never played the sport in his native country until he was 17.\n\"I played water polo all through school, but when my family moved there was no water polo team in our new town,\" said Paris, who lives in Sausalito. \"I heard about this weird sport called underwater hockey. I was a swimmer, but I hated swimming laps. I wanted a sport that was in the water and loved underwater hockey right away.\n\"After I got married, I told my wife we could move anywhere we wanted but there had to be an underwater hockey team there.\"\nUnderwater hockey originated in England in 1954 when the founder of a scuba club devised a method of keeping his members active during the winter months when the frigid sea was too cold for diving.\nBy 1980, the first world championships were held in Canada. The sport, originally called octopush, is especially popular in Great Britain, Canada, parts of Asia and Australia.\n\"In Australian high schools, it is not uncommon for hundreds of people to come to pools to play it every week,\" Zvanut said.\nUnderwater hockey, however, has been a bit slow to catch on in the U.S. Zvanut speculates as to why.\n\"It's difficult to get pool time with so many other sports to compete with,\" Zvanut said. \"And it's not a spectator sport. Americans love their spectator sports.\"\nParis, who along with Zvanut will play for the Sea Lions at the national championships in Minneapolis in July, said teamwork is paramount.\n\"It is going to provide team spirit and team skills,\" Paris said. \"Team strategy works, but as soon as think you can do it on your own, the other team is going to score a goal on you right away. It is a friendly sport with a lot of camaraderie. I have played a lot of sports like soccer and water polo, but underwater hockey is the most team-oriented of all.\"\nZvanut is an accomplished instructor of the sport, and not only does he play the sport at a high level, he coaches a league for children in San Francisco.\n\"Jason is really passionate about sport and he communicates the sport well whether your goal is to be a great player or you just want to play for fun,\" Paris said.\nProspective players can enroll for the class online at College of Marin's websitemarin.edu/communityeducation or they can go into the general admissions office at the college and sign up in person. Cost for the seven-week course running March 26 - May 14 is $118 and includes all equipment and pool time. Zvanut says he also hopes to have an underwater hockey class during the spring semester.\nContact Tim Menicutch via email atsports@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Underwater hockey players compete during a San Francisco tournament in 2010.

She is retiring as executive director as of Jan. 31 and around 100 people showed up to honor her.\n\"There is nothing like watching our kids in a dance performance, or seeing their joy in an art project,\" said Mill Valley Mayor Stephanie Moulton-Peters, noting that Kiddo! raises more than $3 million annually.

The disease was once thought to have been all but eradicated.\nWith 173 cases, a rate of nearly 68 cases per 100,000 people, Marin ranks No. 2 statewide; Nevada County had the highest rate. The disease causes violent coughing, with coughing spells that can last as long as 10 weeks. \nAs to the reason for the increase, \"it's unpredictable. It varies from year to year. We don't always know what determines the extent of a given outbreak, but we do know what we can do to prevent it,\" said Dr. Matt Willis, Marin County's public health officer.\n\"Vaccination can help prevent the spread of pertussis,\" Willis said. \"We do have a lot of parents in Marin County who are hesitant about vaccines and we do know that we can protect ourselves by making sure every child is vaccinated.\"\nWillis said the majority of 2013 Marin pertussis cases occurred in the months of May and June.\n\"We experienced a school-based outbreak that started in May and progressed until school got out in early June,\" Willis said. \"In school, children are gathered in classroom settings and can transmit infection to each other.\nThe outbreak was not confined to any one area, Willis said.\n\"Most schools in Marin were affected. By the end of the year, 26 of our schools reported cases,\" Willis said.\nThe doctor said 160 of Marin's 173 cases were children younger than 19.\n\"Pertussis is spread easily in schools, it's highly contagious and it's a disease that affects children more obviously than adults. Adults get pertussis, but it's a less severe form,\" Willis said. \"Infants are affected the most seriously with pertussis. In the 2010 outbreak of pertussis in California, 10 California infants died.\"\nThe 10 infants were the only pertussis-related deaths that year, according to Health Department information. None of the infants were in Marin, though the county had the state's highest rate of pertussis that year.\nNo one was reported to have died of the disease in California in 2011, 2012 or 2013.\nThe reason infants are more likely to die is that they are too young to have had the entire five-shot regimen recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Also, their immune systems are still developing, the doctor said.\n\"We had a mini-outbreak from April through June of last year that we saw in our office,\" said Sara Koenig, a certified pediatric nurse practitioner with Tamalpais Pediatrics in Greenbrae. Tamalpais Pediatrics, which also has facilities in Novato, has 8,000 child patients.\n\"The majority of the kids we saw were teenagers, freshmen and sophomores in high school,\" Koenig said.\n\"It's important that everybody get vaccinated,\" Koenig said.

It's not a pretty sight.\n\"That darn sun,\" dairyman Bob Giacomini cursed one morning last week, adjusting a patio umbrella to shield federal agricultural official Ann Mills and her entourage from the relentless heat and glare of a cloudless sky.\nMills is U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Undersecretary of Natural Resources and the Environment, and has been named co-chair of the newly formed National Drought Resilience Partnership, seven federal agencies that have banded together to help communities better prepare for droughts and lessen their impact on families and businesses.\nIn West Marin, the impact has been shocking and dismaying. No one has experienced a water crisis this devastating, and the families who have worked the land for generations aren't quite sure what they can do about it. \n\"It's very scary what's happening here,\" frowned Jill Giacomini, who, along with her three sisters, left a professional career to join her father in beginning an award-winning cheese-making business, Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Co., giving the 55-year-old family farm a glamorous new life as a leader in the artisanal food movement.\nThe success story of \"the milkman's daughters\" gained national attention when Jane Pauley came out with a camera crew last summer for a \"Today Show\" segment on how the Giacomini girls have re-imagined their lives as \"the Point Reyes Cheese Sisters.\"\nTo capitalize on their newfound celebrity and generate another source of revenue through agritourism, the family built \"The Fork,\" a handsome visitors center that offers farm tours, culinary classes and a dining room and outdoor patio overlooking Tomales Bay for parties and gatherings.\nWithout rain, there may not be enough water to keep the Fork open much longer.\n\"The guests who come to the Fork would, unfortunately, be the ones who are sacrificed,\" Jill sighed. \"We're going to have to make a lot of changes in our business model.\"\nHer father told the USDA's Mills that West Marin has lost three quarters of its dairies in the past 25 years. Because they were small family farms, they weren't able to compete with the giant agribusinesses in the Central Valley that grow their own feed for their huge herds. In West Marin, ranchers have to depend on winter grass that sprouts on the hilly coastal landscape to feed their cows. Normally, those hills would be blanketed with grass 2 feet tall right now. After the driest year on record and with no rain in sight, the dry brown \"residual\" grass from the season before is mostly gone, essentially leaving bare dirt. Like their neighbors, the Giacominis are being forced to dig deep, buying hay at prices that are rising day by dry day.\n\"We don't have enough water to grow crops (hay) here,\" Bob Giacomini informed his visitors. \"We've got very little underground water. So we're really dependent on rainwater to fill our reservoirs.\"\nWhat has saved the remaining dairies, he pointed out, is the organic food market that has been created in recent years, providing a second source of income for mom and pop operations like his 720-acre dairy just north of Point Reyes Station.\nNow, with the drought, survivors such as himself are being threatened as they never have been before.\n\"With all these forces coming down on us, it's very difficult for us to keep agriculture going here,\" he told Mills. \"The message for you to take back to Washington is the possibility of a serious drought that could be very devastating to all the farms and ranches here, and to the general public. If we can't produce food it's going to get back to the consumer eventually. That's the bottom line.\"\nWith that, he led her on a tour of the dairy, showing her the innovative equipment and pioneering systems the family has installed to conserve what little water there is left. She was shown how they reuse water from an electricity-generating methane digester to flush the alleys behind stalls, and how manure water is sprayed onto pastures by large irrigation guns, saving fresh water for other purposes, such as the 10 low-income houses the Giacominis had built on the farm with low-interest government loans for their employees.\nUnafraid to get her hands dirty, the deputy undersecretary plunged them into a long, neat row of manure, holding a pile of it under her nose to take in its bouquet as if it were a fine wine. A special machine turns the manure every few days so it can be spread on the pastures as compost, allowing the soil to retain water.\nThe family was able to buy all this expensive machinery and install its green systems with the help of grants from the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service, which picked up about half the cost.\nAfter the tour, Mills praised the dairy as \"a model for 21st century agriculture.\"\nAsked what the federal government will do to help, she said, \"We stand ready to work extremely efficiently to provide assistance,\" but was quick to point out \"the budget restrictions we're working under.\"\nWhile dairy farmers are having a tough time of it, cattle ranchers are in even worse shape. Their livelihood depends completely on grazing lands to feed their animals, their only source of income. Many of them rent extra acres that are now worthless, dry patches of bare land without enough grass to hide a jackrabbit.\n\"There's nothing to eat, so you're paying rent on a great big pen,\" lamented Doug Dolcini, a fifth-generation cattleman who runs 750 head on his Red Hill Ranch in Hicks Valley, near the Marin-Sonoma border. \"It's a parking lot for cattle.\"\nWith his son, Grant, he had just driven in from the range in a flatbed truck that hauls bales of hay he buys from a dealer in Southern California's Imperial Valley for $235 a ton, an unusually high price that is expected to go even higher if the dry spell persists. He's burning through $600 a day on hay alone.\n\"We don't have any experience with this,\" he said, squinting through the glare from beneath a straw cowboy hat, his walrus mustache and dusty boots making him look like he wandered off the page of a Zane Grey novel.\nTo cut costs, he plans on selling his older cows five months early, and then some yearlings.\n\"You peck around the edges and hopefully you don't have to get into your best core of animals,\" he explained. \"In the last couple of years, I've read about the Texas drought, thinking, 'Those poor guys, luckily it can't happen here because we're on the coast, the rain comes in, we're safe.' And now look at this. We've never even come close to anything like this. We feel like we're sitting at a card table and we're putting our money in the pot, but we don't know when to say, 'I'm out.'\"\nContact Paul Liberatore via email atliberatore@marinij.com ; follow him on Twitter athttp://twitter.com/LibLarge .

If you're in the doldrums and want to spice up your interior decor, consider adding a few flowering houseplants.\nNot mums or potted gift plants that put on a show for a few weeks then keel over and die, but ones that, with a little effort, can keep blooming throughout the year. Three plants that I've had pretty good luck with are African violets, kalanchoes and phalaenopisis orchids.\nAfrican violets \nAfrican violets are free-blooming plants with thick, fuzzy, textured leaves adorned by clusters of flowers in an array of colors from deepest purple and ruby red to power pink and baby blue. Flowers may be singles or doubles, curly, wavy or heavily fringed. The quilted looking leaves can be spoon- or holly-shaped, ruffled or lacy, in varying shades of green or marbled with creamy yellows and white. Standard-sized plants grow 10 to 12 inches across, miniatures have a petite size of 4 to 6 inches, and there are forms with a naturally spreading habit.\nOriginating in what is now Tanzania, African violets are in the genus Saintpaulia and get their name from their superficial resemblance to true violets. These easy to care for plants have been a favorite for ages as they don't require a dormant period so bloom year round.\nAfrican violets thrive in the same temperatures and humidity that we like, and prefer moderate to bright, indirect, indoor light. Hold your hand over your plant during the time when it is receiving the brightest light; if you can barely see the shadow of your hand over the violets, it the right amount of light.\nWatering is the most crucial aspect for African violet success; soil that is slightly moist to dry is best. Use room temperature water (cold water can cause leaves to curl) and water from the bottom (place in a saucer). Like many plants, too much water can result in root and crown rot that can kill the plant.\nTo keep your African violets blooming, pinch off spent flowers and their stems, and apply a balanced fertilizer (the three numbers on the product label are approximately the same) each time you water, using one-quarter to one-half the concentration recommended on the product label.\nKalanchoe\nPronounced kal-un-KOH-ee, kalanchoe is a little blooming machine that can light up a room with brilliantly colored blossoms encircled by fleshy, glossy, scalloped green leaves. Native to Madagascar, the most common variety, Kalanchoe blossfeldiana, produce abundant sprays of tiny star-shaped blossoms in vivid shades of red, white, orange, yellow and pink.\nPlants do best with bright light and can even tolerate direct sun. As a succulent, they do well with average indoor humidity and require a fast-draining soil mixture. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings. Fertilize plants with a balanced fertilizer at half strength two to three times per season.\nWhen the flowers have faded, cut or pinch them off down to the base of the flower stem. At this point, they like to take a rest so reduce watering (keep them on the dry side) until they begin to set new buds, which requires a minimum of 12 hours of darkness per day. Winter's long night length can provide this if the plant is located in an area with no artificial light.\nPhalaenopisis orchids\nOnce considered an exotic and expensive flowering plant, you now can hardly enter a grocery, big-box or similar store without passing a huge display of dazzling orchids in provocative jewel tones. Phalaenopisis orchids, also known as moth orchids, are the most readily available and easiest orchid to grow. Their elegant, delicate looking blossoms come in myriad shades of white, pink, red, green, yellow, orange and purple and can last for months. They sport oval shaped grassy green leaves, and often have thick, white or silvery aerial roots growing from the orchid plant outward.\nThe branches of trees are the natural environment of these orchids; they thrive in filtered light with two to four hours of bright, indirect light a day being ideal. They should be planted in a soilless mix (primarily bark or sphagnum moss blend) that drains rapidly. Water plants once a week, and allow them to dry out between waterings. Nothing can kill an orchid faster than too much water.\nTo promote blooming, the American Orchid Society recommends using a high phosphorus fertilizer (such as 10-30-20) at one quarter strength with every watering. Monthly, water with plain water to flush out any accumulated fertilizer salts.\nAll three of these plants are readily available and worth a try. A minimum of effort can add some lasting beauty to your indoor decor. Just remember when watering any of these plants, err on the dry side; your plants will love you for it.\nThe University of California Marin Master Gardeners are sponsored by UC Cooperative Extension.

Want to play Herr Zeller, the head Nazi?\" When I stopped laughing, I said yes. As for directing, in 1999 I took the assistant director slot on PCT's \"Pinocchio.\" They then asked me to direct \"The Rainmaker.\"\nQ: How has your background as a computer programmer and technology executive informed your theatrical pursuits?\nA: Two words: people and teamwork.

Teamwork because the best results I've ever gotten have been because I listened to ideas other people brought to the table.\nQ: Could you describe your weekly improv class?\nA: I wanted to present a no stress, low pressure, fun class for beginning or expert improv folks. Each class is comprised of an assortment of improv exercises and games. Participants' ages are 20s to 70s.\nQ: What has doing the class taught you?\nA: Humility at a whole new level. It is an honor to be allowed to coach people into having more fun in their day.\nQ: What's your favorite thing about living in Marin?\nA: Proximity to great hiking trails, beaches, parks, as well as to the city, Wine Country, the Pacific, etc. And Marin's people are generally very positive, involved, caring and approachable.\nContact Nick Bensen by email atcalendar@marinij.com .

Patiently, he waited for a place to open up at the bar. He didn't verbalize the fact that he was waiting nor did he jockey back and forth for position. He also didn't harrumph or ahem. He merely stood.\nWhen a woman came in slightly after him, he allowed her to sit first. He was, in fact, a pleasure to behold. Finally a seat became available, and in simple fashion he sat. Raising one finger at the ceiling, he gave me a nod. \n\"The usual?\"\n\"Yes, please.\"\nThe man seated next to him took notice.\n\"They seem to know you here,\" he said.\n\"Yeah, I come in every once in a while,\" the blond man said, grossly understating the situation.\nSoon thereafter an extra chilly Charbay vodka, in a chilly martini glass garnished with a freshly zested twist appeared before him, almost as if by magic. The magic being provided by yours truly.\n\"Wow,\" said the observing gentleman. \"That is impressive.\"\n\"Yeah, I finally got 'em trained here.\"\nThe two men laughed. I laughed, too. But not for the same reasons.\nI'll be honest, the first time I met the blond man I didn't like him very much. It may shock some of you but not all customers who walk into a bar or restaurant are well liked. How well the staff likes you depends on how you treat them.\nAnd Mr. Blond didn't treat anyone very well.\nBars are an odd province. Someone who will wait 20 minutes patiently in line at a coffee shop or 15 minutes at the deli counter, will freak out after 180 seconds of waiting at a bar. I'm not sure why, but I've seen it happen often.\nMr. Blond was one of those people. Perhaps it had something to do with his divorce. Who knew? But it really didn't matter, because in the service business, you don't necessarily have to like whom you wait upon, you simply have to wait on them. Your feelings are really irrelevant.\nAt first Mr. Blond never waited his turn, he pushed in front of people, he hung around behind others complaining. I had to tell him a half dozen times that people were there before him. I wasn't rude or aggressive, I was just persistent.\nThere is an old saying, \"Never argue with a fool, because then people won't know the difference.\" The same is true with behavior. Direct confrontation rarely yields positive results. Much like a large ship heading for a dock, one person cannot hope to stop it. But, little by little, it can be diverted into a different direction. So it was with Mr. Blond.\n\"I thought it was first-come, first-served,\" he said.\n\"It is. They were here first.\"\nHe watched me refuse service to people who were drinking too much, too quickly. He watched as I told other people the same thing I said to him. He saw that I didn't fight with people; I just applied good reason and a smile to every situation. Now I'm not saying everyone liked everything I did, but they all knew the rules. It wasn't personal.\nAlong the way, Mr. Blond also learned that ordering a martini was never enough information. He eventually started asking questions, instead of barking out orders. And slowly, ever so slowly, he began to learn.\nWeeks turned into months and months turned into years. Mr. Blond eventually got over his divorce and then he met someone else, and then after that someone else. He learned patient persistence eventually yields good results.\nAnd I'm pretty sure he learned that from me.\nThat's why I laughed at his suggestion. Because the only thing that has changed about the way I've treated him is that when I say, \"It's nice to see you,\" I really mean it.\nJeff Burkhart is an award-winning bartender at a local restaurant.

I needed my elbows on the table to catch my head from nodding off into the mashed potatoes when my dad launched off into another story about, \"Children in Europe starving, because I wasn't eating my Brussels sprouts.\" \nI always wondered if kids in Brussels were being told by their parents that, \"Children in Appalachia are starving, so eat your meatloaf.\"\nMy parents were determined that when I became royalty (They were certain that would be the case because they had it on good authority that our family was somehow related to the Romanovs before the Russian revolution), I would need to know where you put the dessert spoon while entertaining the intelligentsia.\nTurned out the laugh was on them when an extensive research project on our family tree showed that rather than living a life draped in ermine robes, our family came from a long line of horse thieves. I suppose that speaks at least in part to my innate ability to handicap the Kentucky Derby.\nBut, I digress. My parents sent me to a workshop very similar to the one being offered in February by Daily Protocol, and very much like the rest of my schooling, I flunked out.\nI was doing very well with not burping or wiping my mouth with the tablecloth when the oh-so-proper matron running the workshop asked me, \"Should olives be eaten with the fingers?\" I suppose I would have passed the class had I of not gone for the gag line rather than a simple yes or no. \"No, I believe the fingers should be eaten separately,\" I offered. Big laughs from my assembled peers, and a hearty handshake and polite \"Thank you so much for coming,\" from the matron.\nSomehow though, over the course of time I have learned what side the bread plate goes on and what side and in what order the glasses go, I know to spoon soup away from rather than toward the mouth, and I know how to hold and use a knife and fork. I will still, on occasion have my elbows on the table   depending on the conversation.\nMy son, on the other hand, is of the belief that there are only two choices when it comes to utensils   none, or a spear. The only thing that isn't finger food for him is soup   and that's about 50-50. I don't want to be too critical of his eating habits though because he promised he'd bring us a mammoth for Thanksgiving dinner this year.\nI am thinking of enrolling him in the etiquette and dining essentials workshop. It says he'll learn communication essentials, family politeness, conversation cues and place setting knowledge.\nNot only would it be good for him, but I could learn something too.\nI've never have known what side of the plate the spear goes on.\nBarry Tompkins is a longtime sports broadcaster who lives in Marin.

My heart broke into a thousand pieces until God and the universe led me to the Brown House.\nThe grand reception that I received there shielded me from the cold and rain. It nourished us, healed my wounds and the wounds of my sons.\nIt offers everything to enable people to make changes in their life.\nThe beloved Brown House, if it could speak, would speak of infinite real-life stories. My life and that of my children has been wonderful since we found a space there.\nThanks to Homeward Bound, thanks to all the staff, thanks to the blessed people who make donations and volunteer time and thanks for having such a big heart, thanks for helping.\nEdith Beltran, Mill Valley\nGrateful for symphony\nIt is not often that you attend a concert and are mesmerized by works and the performance.\nEspecially if one of the works is relatively unknown. Such was the case with the Tuesday night performance of the Marin Symphony.\nTwo American works, Joseph Schwanter's \"New Morning for the World\" and the Aaron Copland's \"Symphony No. 3\" were performed.\nI had never heard the Schwanter work before and was enthralled and emotionally moved by the work and the fabulous rendition by Noah Griffin, the narrator, and Alasdair Neale, the conductor of the Marin Symphony.\nThe powerful and lyrical Copland \"Symphony No. 3\" concluded the performance. This program was called \"American Dream\" and these two works were a perfect fit for the title.\nMarin does not realize how lucky it is to have such a great orchestra and one that performs such varied and heartfelt music.\nI have heard orchestras all over the world and I am grateful that we have an orchestra that creates such excellent and varied programs coupled with outstanding and sensitive performances from all those musicians involved.\nGary Gruber, San Rafael", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 26"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "AS public health officer for Marin County, I work daily to create an environment in which everyone can make healthy choices. I am also a parent of three young children who will grow up in this community.\nThis winter, several of Marin's young people died from accidental overdoses of prescription drugs; many more were likely at risk.\nI have a personal and professional interest in protecting our youth from the harms of substance use. Prescription drug misuse and abuse needs our attention. \nLike other Marin parents, grandparents, teachers and other concerned adults, my wife and I know that substance use is one of the many challenges our kids will face.\nWe talk to them about the dangers of excessive alcohol use, drunk and drugged driving, and the risks of street drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. We also need to educate ourselves and our youth about the potential harms from prescription drugs.\nMany people mistakenly assume that prescription drugs are safer than traditional street drugs because they are prescribed by a physician.\nPrescription drug misuse is one of the nation's fastest growing health problems, and Marin County is not immune.\nAccording to the National Council on Patient Information and Education, one in five teens, or 4.5 million young people, has abused prescription drugs.\nMarin's 11th graders reported misusing prescription pain killers, sedatives and barbiturates at the same rate as their California peers. The rate of stimulant misuse among Marin County 11th graders is 25 percent greater than the state average.\nPrescription drug misuse is defined as the non-medical use of prescribed medication. We most commonly see this in narcotic pain relievers like Oxycodone and Percocet, sedatives like Valium and Xanax, and stimulants such as Adderall.\nAlthough Marin is recognized as one of the healthiest counties in California, we have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and other substances including prescription drugs.\nIn Marin, more people die from misusing prescription drugs than from motor vehicle accidents.\nPrescription drugs are becoming the new gateway drug. Of the 3 million Americans who began using illicit drugs in 2010, one in four began by misusing prescription drugs. After marijuana and alcohol, prescription drugs are the most commonly abused substances among young people\nPrescription medicines are also easy to obtain.\nAccording to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, more than half of the people who misuse prescription drugs got them from friends and relatives. In many cases, the drugs our children are misusing are coming from our own medicine cabinets.\nHow do we assure these medications are used safely for health reasons, while also preventing their abuse?\nWe must sound the alarm.\nSeveral Marin adolescents began abusing prescription drugs in high school and then accidentally overdosed in their first years of college. To prevent such tragedies, some things you can do today are to lock up your medicines, keep track of your medication quantities and learn how to properly dispose of unused medications.\nWe also encourage you to use \"teachable moments\" with your children while watching television or when taking medications to talk about how these drugs can be harmful or dangerous. It is never too early to start talking to your youth about the harms of prescription drug misuse and abuse.\nPrescription drug misuse is a complex public health problem, contributing to unintentional drug poisonings, fatal overdoses, community violence and loss of human potential.\nWe as a community need to come together and work on some smart solutions. The Marin County Department of Health and Human Services is convening a group of key community stakeholders to gain a clearer understanding of the issue and to create a comprehensive plan for reducing prescription drug misuse and abuse in our community.\nDr. Matthew Willis is Marin County's public health officer.

It can be a harrowing experience.\nThis project is far more than a ferry connection; it is part of a world-class multi-use pathway facility. The Central Marin Ferry Connection Project completes a key link in Marin's North-South Greenway which extends from the Golden Gate Bridge to Novato and, when SMART is completed, will extend all the way to Cloverdale.\nIt provides a fundamentally important connection between northern and southern Marin and creates a safe and critical link for users traveling between the Larkspur, Corte Madera, Larkspur Ferry, the SMART station and destinations to the north via the Cal Park Tunnel.\nThe Central Marin Ferry Connection project is a key element in providing an additional choice for transit riders and in helping to reduce traffic in this congested corridor.\nCyclists using this facility have the additional benefit of ample free bicycle parking at the Larkspur ferry, an incentive that can further increase ridership.\nElected officials from every jurisdiction throughout Marin have strongly and wisely supported this project for over a decade, even prior to the removal of the trestle that was taken down in 2003.\nThe project has been in adopted county planning documents for more than 14 years and is widely recognized as an important part of the county's nonmotorized network.\nThis project was funded in part by the more than $25 million of congressional nonmotorized transportation pilot program funds that came to Marin thanks to the diligent leadership of the Marin County Bicycle Coalition's prior executive director, Deb Hubsmith.\nThis money was awarded specifically for bicycle/pedestrian projects such as this one, for the purpose of increasing bicycling and walking mode share. Additional funds for this project came from other bike/ped federal, state and regional sources, some of which could not have been used elsewhere in the county for bike/ped projects.\nThis is the right project, at the right time, in the right location.\nAs with all networks (rail, road and nonmotorized, alike), there are some infrastructure elements that are cheap and some are expensive. Rail engineers or road builders would never build a road to a river's edge without making plans to cross it because of cost.\nThis project is critical for building Marin's bicycle and pedestrian network and well worth every penny spent. The alternative is more people in their cars, more obesity, fewer people living an active lifestyle and less freedom and choices of mobility here in Marin, especially for our aging population.\nWhile Marin has several more bicycle/pedestrian network gaps to close, today we are celebrating the awarded bid for the Central Marin Ferry Connection Project, along with several new segments of SMART pathway which will be built over the coming year.\nThe project is truly a bright light at the end of the Cal Park Tunnel and the Marin County Bicycle Coalition, more than ever, celebrates this milestone that is taking us all into a future of active, healthy transportation, creating a safer and healthier Marin County.\nAndy Peri is the advocacy director for the Marin County Bicycle Coalition in Fairfax.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: A bicyclist makes his way along the Cal Park Hill Tunnel multi-use pathway toward Larkspur Landing in Larkspur, Calif. on Tuesday, Dec. 3, 2013.

They did it in less than 90 minutes.\nThey were all visiting the Bay Model in Sausalito, where time and distance are a little shorter than they are in the real world. In this scaled down simulacrum of the bay and beyond, the 24-hour cycle of tides occurs every 14.9 minutes, with Marin County tap water streaming in and out of the Golden Gate. You can travel from the mountains to the sea by walking up a ramp, meandering through a hallway with murals of the delta on the walls and then breaking out into the expanse of San Francisco's three interconnected bays, all spread out in a gigantic scale model the size of two football fields. \n\"There's nothing like a three-dimensional model to really make sense of things,\" said Christine Arman of Los Gatos, who was visiting the model with her husband, Mark, and their two children, Geneva, 2, and 12-year-old Charlie. \"I'm a Bay Area native. I grew up on the Peninsula. But I still didn't fathom the size of the bay and the wetlands around it. It's interesting to see how big it really is.\"\nThe Armans were along on the free \"Trekking the Model\" tour, a monthly event led on Saturday by Army Corps of Engineers Senior Ranger Bill Cope, whom everyone calls \"Ranger Bill.\"\n\"The Bay Model probably saved San Francisco Bay,\" he told the tour group, explaining how it was originally built in 1957 to test a radical plan by theater producer John Reber to build dams at the mouth of the Sacramento River that would feed two freshwater lakes within the bay, supplying drinking water for the Bay Area.\n\"Fortunately,\" Cope said, \"it failed.\"\nConstructed inside a former parts warehouse for Marinship, the famed Sausalito shipyard that built Liberty Ships during World War II, the Bay Model was a scientific research facility until January of 2000, when computer technology made it obsolete.\n\"Then it's mission changed to education and culture,\" Cope explained, noting that up to 160,000 people a year visit the Bay Model from all over the world, including China, the Netherlands and Japan.\n\"They come here just to see this historic model, the only operational hydraulic working model in all of America, perhaps the entire western hemisphere,\" he said.\nOperated by the Corps of Engineers, the facility also features a number of fascinating side exhibits, including a popular diorama that uses colored white and blue lights to show how the snow pack melts in the Sierra, sending water down through the delta and out into the bay. In this drought year, the diorama takes on added impact.\n\"It really makes you want to go home and conserve water,\" said Reta McEwen, who was visiting from Stanislaus County with her husband, Mark, and college student daughter, Mary, 22, who took the day off from classes at UC Santa Cruz to see the Bay Model, a trip she's wanted to take with her parents for three years.\n\"It's really cool,\" she said, heading off to take a second look at things she may have missed on the tour. The model may be a scaled down version of the real thing, but it is in no way a miniature. Asked what surprised her most about it, she said,\n\"It's huge. It's so much bigger than I expected.\"\nContact Paul Liberatore via email atliberatore@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Erica Cooper, 10, of San Francisco, looks at a model of California during a tour of the Bay Model in Sausalito, Calif. on Saturday, Jan. 26, 2014.

Memo Gidley and Matteo Malucelli were admitted to a Daytona Beach hospital Saturday night for further testing following a two-car accident right before the three-hour mark of the Rolex 24 at Daytona.\nIMSA officials said both drivers were awake and communicating, but gave no other information about their conditions.\nGidley, a resident of Novato, was driving for the pole-winning GAINSCO/Bob Stallings Racing team. He had to be cut out of the No. 99 Corvette, which crumpled like an accordion when he plowed into the back of Malucelli's Ferrari. \nThe cars were heading into the kink in the infield portion of the track facing directly into the sun. Malucelli's car had apparently lost power   his team said he radioed he was pulling out of the way   as the cars headed into a high-speed turn.\nAt the same time, Gidley tried to lap a slower car. He pulled out to the left and tried to duck under the lapped car, apparently didn't see Malucelli off the pace, and drove directly into the Ferrari at nearly full speed.\nThe race was red-flagged as emergency workers tended to both drivers. They were placed onto stretchers, loaded into ambulances and taken to Halifax Health Medical Center, located roughly a mile outside the race track.\n\"This stuff, it happens, it's racing. But you never expect it to be your car, your team,\" said Gidley teammate Darren Law.\nOlivier Beretta, Malucelli's teammate on the Risi Competizione team, saw a replay of the accident and wondered if the glare played a role in the wreck.\n\"It's difficult to say because it's the sun going down, and in this corner you don't see very well,\" Beretta said. \"I don't know. I honestly don't know. The most important thing right now is Matteo, the rest I don't care. It's just Matteo and the other driver.\"\nMany drivers inquired about Gidley's condition. Christian Fittipaldi passed by the accident scene before the race was stopped and was concerned for Gidley's well-being.\n\"At that point, conditions were really hard. The sun was setting. There were two points on the track where you couldn't see anything,\" Fittipaldi said. \"One was at start-finish and the other point was coming out of Turn 3 and coming out of the kink. I imagined there was a slow car ahead of him and he couldn't see.\"\nThe clock ticked off roughly 90 minutes under combined red and yellow flag following the accident before racing resumed. The sun had gone down and the drivers had turned on their headlights by the time the field went green again.\nThe bizarre accident was yet another disappointment for the GAINSCO team, which was the surprising pole winner Thursday despite limited preseason testing and a thin budget that has the organization planning to run only five of the 13 events in the in the inaugural United SportsCar Championship season.\nThe odds were stacked against the GAINSCO team winning the race   since 1994 only three pole winners have reached Victory Lane in the twice-around-the-clock endurance event   but a strong showing would have sufficed.\nAlthough the team won the pole in 2007 and finished second in 2008, it has finished no better than seventh since and had DNF's in 2010 and was 89 laps off the pace in 2012.\nWhen racing did resume, the event got its feel good moment when Wayne Taylor came out of retirement to briefly get behind the wheel of the No. 10 Wayne Taylor Racing Corvette.\nThe 58-year-old last raced in 2010, in this event, but was talked into driving one stint as an opportunity to join the lineup with sons with Ricky and Jordan. The opportunity came about when Ricky rejoined the team that won the Grand-AM driver championship last season with Jordan Taylor and Max Angelelli.\nWayne Taylor, despite his vocal reluctance to do much in the car, seemed to be on pace as he battled Indianapolis 500 winner Tony Kanaan.\n\"My Dad just held Tony Kanaan off for two laps. I have a very cool Dad!\" Jordan Taylor posted on Twitter.\nThe plan had been for Ricky Taylor, who started the race, to turn the car over to his father. But the driver change came as the sun was setting, and the team decided at the last minute to instead have Angelelli drive second.\n\"When I got out of the car, there was a big glare and he has had trouble with his eyes and his old age,\" Ricky Taylor said, laughing slightly. \"We would like to put him in in the nighttime, and preferably under yellow, because he's also a little on the shorter side. He has a big insert in his seat and we have to get him snug in there tight. We have to loosen our belts up a lot.\"\nHis sons said their father has been protesting competing in the event, but they believe he's secretly enjoying himself.\n\"After the race he will look back on it and be very happy that we made it happen and that we got through it,\" Ricky Taylor said. \"He is hating it. He doesn't enjoy driving anymore. He always wants to get out of the car. But every time he is finished driving, he's happy.\"", "author": "IJ news services", "title": "Novato's Gidley injured in crash at Rolex 24"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "A squirrel chewed through insulation on an electrical line on Friday night, knocking out power to 2,311 homes in Kentfield, Greenbrae and Larkspur.\nElectricity went off at 8 p.m. and was restored at 9:36 p.m. The animal damaged the line on Corte Lenosa in Greenbrae just north of Bon Air Road, according to Pacific Gas & Electric spokesman J.D.

Harris said. \"If we want to make the conference playoffs, we have to win at home.\" \nWith the victory, the Penguins moved two games ahead of Notre Dame for the sixth and final postseason conference berth.\nDominican, which lost 75-65 to Chaminade three weeks ago in Honolulu, appeared in danger of letting the game slip away in the second half when the Silver Swords (12-7, 9-2) unleashed a 3-point scoring barrage that left the Penguins trailing by nine with 3:06 remaining in regulation.\nInstead of folding, however, the Penguins fired back with sophomore guard Matt Hayes   a team-high 21 points, 14 coming in the second half  producing most of the ammo.\nHayes drove the lane and converted a 3-point play the old-fashioned way, and 30 seconds later, knocked down a long-range 3 from the corner to quickly trim Chaminade's lead to three.\nDominican caught a break when slippery guard and Chaminade's leading scoring Lee Bailey, who scored his 1,000th career point earlier in the contest, clanked two free throws.\nAnother sophomore guard, Christopher Schwartz-Edmisten, who had cooled off after coming off the bench to score 15 first-half points, made the Silver Swords pay when he drilled an outside jumper to cut the lead to one.\nBailey, who led all scorers with 22 points, made amends for his errant free throws with a driving layup, but Dominican's Connor Haysbert knotted the score at 73-73 when he tore through a wall of opposing players for an offensive rebound and follow shot, was fouled and converted the free throw.\nDominican, who lost had lost four of five on a its recent road trip, never trailed in overtime and led by as many as four points when Dominique Taplin took a pass from Schwartz-Edmisten and buried a clean-look 3-pointer.\nBailey, however, was persistent, He scored the next four points to tie it again at 82-82, and 30 seconds later, teammate Tyree Harrison converted one of two free throws to give his team an 84-83 lead.\nWith 14 seconds remaining, Harris called a timeout. Golston scored his game-winner with 11 seconds left and Chaminade's last ditch outside shot at the buzzer banged off the iron.\n\"It was a tough one,\" Hayes said. \"They had beat us three times in a row (twice last year) and it kind of left a bitter taste in our mouths. We had some players out tonight and some other guys really stepped up.\"\nMost notably missing for the Penguins was starting senior guard Myles Carrillo, averaging 11.6 points, who was sidelined by back spasms.\n\"Schwartz-Edmisten had some big points in the first half and kept us in the game,\" Harris said. \"And Hayes came up big in the second half, especially with Carrillo out and Taplin in foul trouble.\"\nContact Tim Menicutch via email atsports@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Domonique Taplin (25) of Dominican University makes a lay up as Lee Bailey (5) and Kuany Kuany (14) of Chaminade University look on during their game in San Rafael, Calif. on Saturday, Jan. 26, 2014.

The lower school, which serves pre-kindergarten to eighth grade, is co-ed.\nSome current students said they plan to transfer from San Domenico because of the school's decision to go co-ed. A Facebook page called \"Keep San Domenico Upper School All Girls\" has nearly 300 members, a number that continues to grow by the day.\nThough not everyone connected to the school is distraught about the decision   many favor it, including students and parents   the backlash underscores the fervor that students and graduates of single-gender schools have for their alma maters.\nClaire Fontana, a 1993 graduate of San Domenico, is one of the leading voices for keeping the school all-girls.\n\"It was just such a special part of my life that I wish other girls would get to experience,\" Fontana said. In high school, \"we're trying to figure out who we are as people. There's no question that you feel far more accepted (in an all-girls setting) than in a co-ed environment.\"\nThe issue isn't about being anti-boys, Fontana said, but rather about providing the right learning environment for girls.\nThe debate is not isolated to this one campus in San Anselmo. Researchers throughout the country study whether a single-gender educational environment is better for learning. Many researchers say it is, at least for females.\nLinda Sax, a professor in UCLA's Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, said the numbers show that girls in single-gender schools tend to excel more.\n\"In general, I do find from the research that there does seem to be significant differences between single sex and co-ed education, in that the girls from single-sex schools tend to be more academically engaged,\" Sax said.\nGirls in single-gender environments tend to thrive in the STEM subjects   science, technology, engineering and math   areas in which they otherwise \"underrate themselves,\" Sax said.\nWhat the research doesn't show, Sax said, is whether single-gender schools tend to attract more academically driven students. If so, the implication is that the girls at these schools are likely to excel, regardless of the school's structure.\n\"The question is, can the effective elements of a single-sex environment translate to a co-ed environment,\" Sax said, \"or is it necessary to have a single-sex environment?\"\nOthers argue that the single-gender environment does matter. Without boys in the classroom, girls are said to feel safer to express themselves and are more likely to be assertive, since they aren't concerned about being judged by the opposite sex. That leads to speaking up more in class discussions and taking leadership roles in the school.\nKathy Schultz, dean of the School of Education at the all-women's Mills College in Oakland, said the single-gender environment is crucial for some females.\n\"There are plenty of young women who can do really well in any setting they're in, but for some people, to have that all-girls setting is really critical,\" Schultz said. \"Every time an all-girls institution closes, you close off opportunities for a large number people who actually thrive in those institutions.\"\nThe question is, just how many are seeking out these institutions?\nSan Domenico found the answer is: not enough.\n\"In our feasibility study, we saw that in our marketplace there was just such a small percentage of girls and boys who were looking at single-gender education,\" said San Domenico board member Janet Reilly.\nBetween the shrinking demand for single-gender schools and the rising cost of attending independent private schools   annual tuition exceeds $30,000 at many of them   the pool of families seeking a school such as San Domenico is limited.\nGoing co-ed doubles the number of potential candidates.\nLiz Schott, superintendent of the Kentfield School District, attended San Domenico and served as its director of admissions in the 1980s. Schott, who favors the switch to co-ed at the school, said the school was struggling with enrollment when she worked there 30 years ago.\n\"I'm impressed and shocked they've been able to keep the school open as long as they have, overcoming such obstacles of enrollment,\" Schott said. \"It's incredibly difficult to keep operating at that size and maintain any desirable programs.\"\nMarin's other private independent schools have survived with the co-ed format.\nBranson School, in Ross has morphed several times in its nearly 100 years of existence. It's gone from a co-ed elementary school to an all-girls high school with day and boarding students. It added an all-boys school, Mount Tamalpais School, to the campus in 1972. Then within a decade, the boarding component of the girls' school was phased out, and the boys and girls were eventually combined into one school.\nMarin Academy, in San Rafael, has been a co-ed school since opening in 1971. It took over a campus that had been vacated a year earlier with the closure of an all-boys military school.\nSanta Catalina School in Monterey faces similar challenges as San Domenico. Like San Domenico, Santa Catalina's lower school is co-ed, while its upper school is all-girls and includes day and boarding students.\nAdministrators at Santa Catalina's upper school said families have more educational options than ever for their children   such as charter, Waldorf and Montessori schools   and children have more say in determining where they want to go to school. That creates a challenge to keep enrollment up.\n\"From a marketing standpoint, you have to think about the parents' perspective and the students' perspective, and really reach out to the two different audiences,\" said Rich Patterson, Santa Catalina's assistant head of school of advancement. \"We realize in the admissions office that we have to work as hard as we've ever worked.\"\nAt San Domenico, they decided that remaining all girls was no longer feasible. So, they're adapting to the market in hopes of keeping their classrooms open long term to continue providing a private, college preparatory education   to whomever seeks it.\n\"We've been very successful,\" said Stock, San Domenico's Head of School. \"But we want to continue to be successful and to be able to serve students.\"\nContact Laith Agha via email atlagha@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: San Domenico student Elyzah Bernstein, second right, express her view in support of San Domerico's controversial announcement to open high school enrollment to boys.

Jerry Brown's declaration of a drought emergency in California. Supervisor Steve Kinsey several months ago asked water agencies to get together and report back on the drought and what they are doing to cope. \nThe event is intended as an informational session as well as an opportunity to elevate public awareness about the potential consequences of the water crisis, which has cut Marin reservoir levels in half and dried up 95 percent of the pasture land.\n\"No current issue poses a greater risk to our residents, businesses, and environment than the possibility of a prolonged drought,\" Kinsey said. \"Though talking about the weather never changed it, this forum will give the public and our board an accurate understanding of what each of the water agencies in Marin is doing and the additional conservation efforts we should all be taking.\"\n\"It's critically important to use every avenue to raise public awareness about the severity of the situation,\" Supervisor Katie Rice said. \"Droughts do not discriminate. Everyone and every organization needs be taking steps to start seriously conserving water right now.\"\nLibby Pischel, spokeswoman for Marin Municipal, said water agencies welcome the county's public forum. \"It's a community-wide concern,\" she said. \"We are glad to have the opportunity for a conversation with the Board of Supervisors.\"\nA session designed especially for Marin businesses is being planned as well by the Marin Economic Forum.\nLiza Crosse, a Marin Municipal director who serves as Kinsey's aide, called the drought a \"looming crisis\" requiring the attention of all.\n\"In the face of this extraordinary year, the water suppliers are working overtime to address the extremely urgent need to reduce water consumption,\" Crosse said. \"They are continuing their work on long-term water solutions.\"\nKey county departments are expected to report on what they are doing to conserve water, with several already taking action, including Fire Chief Jason Weber, who ordered a 25 percent reduction in water use at fire stations, shut down landscape irrigation and hired 14 seasonal firefighters in light of high fire danger in mid-winter.\nLongtime Marin residents are no strangers to the hardships of drought. Before three bone-dry years ended with 67 inches of rain in the winter of 1977-78, Marin residents faced rationing of 37 gallons a day per person, with supplies piped in through an emergency conduit on the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. The crisis became so pronounced that then Rep. John Burton flirted with the idea of towing an iceberg in from Alaska.\nOn average, Marin Municipal reservoirs are at 79 percent capacity at this time of year, but now stand at just 54 percent. Last year, only 10.68 inches of rain fell at Lake Lagunitas, down from an average 52 inches, making it the driest year since officials began recording totals in 1879.\nWhile Gov. Brown ordered a series of conservation moves and asked residents to cut water use 20 percent, Marin Municipal officials hope to squeeze out a voluntary 25 percent cut in use. If that doesn't work and dry weather persists, a mandatory 25 percent cut in use will be ordered April 1, depending on reservoir levels.\n\"We are preparing for a severe drought,\" according to Jon LaHaye, a water district engineer.\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

Affordable housing advocates see it as a way to bolster that housing stock.\nBut neighbors of the parcel enjoy the open space and the wildlife that uses the land as a refuge. The City Council will have to decide what to do with the land and last week the community got an update from the Butte Street Task Force, which has looked at various options.\nIt has recommended the city find a land trust to buy the land and keep it as open space. In October, the City Council agreed to allow the task force to pursue that option, but Mayor Ray Withy said it's not a done deal.\n\"The task force came to us with a preliminary recommendation for open space. We did not authorize that, what we said was that it was not out of the question,\" Withy said. \"I'm keeping an open mind on this and we still have to have public hearings.\"\nLeon Huntting, chairman of the task force, said the council gave a vote of approval to find a land trust to purchase the property from the Hunt family and that the city would donate its half of the land for open space.\n\"What we are looking for is ratification from the City Council,\" Huntting said of a potential deal.\nFormer mayor Ron Albert, an affordable housing advocate, said he is not entirely opposed to allowing the Butte Street property to remain as open space if the city can provide another property in its stead.\n\"If the city takes away that housing property, they need to replace it, but this needs to happen at the same time,\" Albert said.\nAlbert noted that there could be opportunities for housing between Bridgeway and the waterfront   but not on the waterfront   as the city reviews its Marinship Plan.

The North Marin Water District, which provides water to Novato and West Marin to 60,000 people, gets 80 percent of its water from Sonoma and the rest from Stafford Lake.\n\"What happens with the Sonoma County Water Agency is very important to us,\" said Chris DeGabriele, general manager of the North Marin Water District.\nAs in Marin, the Sonoma County Water Agency's primary reservoirs   Lake Sonoma and Lake Mendocino   rely on rainfall. Those reservoirs also have been affected by the dry skies. Lake Sonoma is at 67 percent of capacity, when normally it would be full. Mendocino is at 37 capacity and would normally be 90 percent or more.\n\"We need rain and it hasn't come,\" said Brad Sherwood, spokesman for the agency. \"It's disheartening to see all the rain clouds being pushed to the north and south.\"\nAnd correspondingly water levels have dropped in the Sonoma County reservoirs. Key is Lake Sonoma, from which Marin County gets its supplies. Water from the reservoir flows into Dry Creek, then into the Russian River, where it is gathered in ponds. Groundwater is then tapped and supplies are sent south to Marin via a series of pipelines.\nBuilt in 1984, the expansive Lake Sonoma reservoir has a capacity of 245,000 acre feet. An acre foot can supply about three single-family homes with water for a year. There are 325,851 gallons in an acre foot. By comparison, all seven of the Marin Municipal Water District reservoirs hold a little less than 80,000 acre feet. Those reservoirs currently hold 43,340 acre feet of water.\nEven though Lake Sonoma is currently holding only 163,000 acre feet, that is enough to provide enough water for the year. Marin Municipal Water District officials have also said there is likely enough water for the year, but both agencies say more conservation steps will likely be needed as 2014 progresses if rains do not come.\n\"The real problems come when you don't have rain for two years in a row,\" said Larry Russell, Marin Municipal board member.\nBoth agencies worry that a dry fall and winter this year could be catastrophic.\n\"We are certainly thankful for Lake Sonoma, but we do not want to rest on our laurels,\" Sherwood said. \"We need people to step up to the conservation challenge.\"\nSaid Sonoma Water Agency Director Mike McGuire: \"Unless we have a fantastic February or miracle March, our region will face a drought unlike any other ... we need to double down on our conservation efforts.\"\nContact Mark Prado via email atmprado@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: A tire lies exposed on dried mud by Stafford Lake in Novato, Calif. on Thursday, Jan. 9, 2014.

In Marin, they are tall enough to stir public ire.\nCorte Madera Town Council members who approved the plans prefer to argue that they were forced to approve the project. It was, they've said, their best shot to meet their regional affordable housing quota.\nSo they approved building 180 units so they could get 18 low-rent apartments toward the town's quota, which was then 244 units. That doesn't sound like much of a bargain, especially for a project in Marin, where the task of winning approvals is usually formidable enough to send developers packing.\nThe idea of increasing the number of market-rate units in order to get more affordable apartments does not seem to be a sensible scenario.\nIs the affordable housing needed? No question.\nCorte Madera has a regional responsibility to plan for local housing for workers at its shopping centers.\nThe construction is not finished, but the apartment complex has few admirers. Observers say it is just too big for its location. It might be the right fit for Walnut Creek, but not Marin.\nEven Corte Madera council members say they now wish they hadn't voted for it.\n\"We voted for something that we wish would have been half that size,\" said Mayor Michael Lappert.\nMeanwhile, supervisors are taking shots at the council's decision.\n\"The Board of Supervisors had nothing to do with it,\" said Supervisor Katie Rice.\nNearly 40 years ago, the county adopted a then cutting-edge growth plan that implemented zoning to protect West Marin from suburban sprawl and focus Marin's future growth along Highway 101.\nThat doesn't mean Highway 101 should be lined by giant apartment complexes.\nCorte Madera town officials need to take a hard look at their development standards, just as the Novato City Council did after the construction of the Millworks triggered public protests that are still repeated today.\nAs the people elected to shape their city, the best council members use long-range vision in approving development that complements the community   buildings that people will be living with for years.\nStrong local leadership is needed, not to stop development, but to make sure that it is a good fit, in purpose, size and design.\nGiven the fury created by Corte Madera's project, Town Council members are probably growing tired of hearing: \"Who approved that?\"\nSupervisors don't need to point fingers at the council. They should take care of their own business and make sure they don't follow the same path of logic Corte Madera followed in trying to meet housing needs.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Apartment buildings under construction rise at the site of the old Wincup building on Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2013, in Corte Madera, Calif.

Or not. It's hard to know.\nWindow film   a transparent barrier that, its makers say, keeps big bad sun rays from eating up your furniture and driving up your air-conditioning bills   is at its best unseen.\nAnd that's the problem. How do you know it's there? Because it's invisible, I'm tempted to put it in the same category as the Emperor's New Clothes, or as those who buy and sell galactic stars. I worry that homeowners are buying into some big transparent lie. \nIt's like sunscreen for windows, those with more faith tell me. But I want more proof. Plus, I have other concerns about sunscreen for windows:\n* I like natural light in a house. Why kill it?\n* I like sunshine. I grew up on the West Coast, where getting a great tan was like a second career. When I did know better, I avoided the sun. Now I have Vitamin D deficiency.\n* I like conspicuous consumption. I'd rather buy a new area rug than some non-obvious, no-fun home improvement.\n* I've seen bad window jobs.\nDarrell Smith, executive director of the International Window Film Association, a group of manufacturers, distributors and installers, welcomes my skepticism.\n\"We're trying to provide accurate information to those who have misinformation that is over 20 years old,\" he said.\n\"I'm your target,\" I said, then shot my opening round. \"I don't like how window tinting affects interior color.\"\n\"No, no, no,\" Smith assured. \"You can get products today that don't affect color.\"\nI'm dubious.\nHe explains. Years ago, window films used to screen damaging light rays either by adding a dark color to the film, which would absorb the heat and harmful rays, or by adding metal to the film that would reflect them.\n\"Today's technology uses absorbing metals and materials that have reflectors we can't see,\" said Smith. \"The harmful rays are still absorbed or reflected, but this work is done outside the visible light spectrum.\"\n\"Ohhh. So it's like the NSA.\"\n\"In the past, if a window film stopped 65 percent of the solar energy, it would block 65 percent of the light, too,\" said Smith. \"Today's films can stop solar energy and be color neutral.\"\n\"That's clearly better,\" I said, coming around.\nHere are more points Smith said homeowners should know about getting great protection, even if they never see it:\n*\nColor neutral options. \"If you don't want to change the color of your home's natural light or see any metallic shine, ask for a color neutral day-lighting film,\" said Smith. Your windows will save energy but give up next to nothing in light quality.\n*\nLower bills. In hot weather, solar-control films can block up to 80 percent of the solar energy coming through windows, which cuts down on air conditioning. \"It usually translates into a year-round savings of about 5 to 10 percent of the home's total energy bill,\" said Smith.\n*\nAdded protection. Visible light lies on the spectrum between ultraviolet, which damages furniture, and infrared, which beams heat. Treated windows will block 99 percent of UVA and UVB rays, thus greatly slowing the deterioration and fading of drapes, carpet and furniture.\n*\nDecorative applications. Today's films can also inexpensively make clear glass look etched or frosted for privacy or a decorative effect.\n*\nNot a fix. If your window is in bad shape, leaking or poorly insulated, adding film won't fix that. Deteriorating windows should be replaced. However, if your windows are in good shape, don't replace them just for energy efficiency, said Smith. Try film first.\n*\nWarranty on work. And read it before you sign a contract. You should be protected against bad installations. Signs of a bad job include film that peels or lifts at the edges, or little bubbles under the film.\n*\nWord of warning. Many window manufacturers will invalidate their warranty if you do anything to their windows, including adding window film. If your windows are still under warranty, find out how adding film will affect that protection. Get it in writing.\n*\nMoney back. If you had window film installed in 2012 or 2013, you could get a federal energy tax credit of up to 10 percent of the cost of installation up to $500. Ask your utility company if they offer a credit toward your energy bill if you treat your windows.\n*\nHow much? Cost to coat a 5-foot-by-6-foot window can vary from $120 to $270, depending on where you live, said Smith. Shop around. (You can find an installer in your area atiwfa.com .) You'll find the best deals in winter, which is why we're talking about this now.

This year you won't have to do it in the rain. \n* Order yards of organic compost to amend your garden for happy spring and summer plants.\n* Stroll your neighborhood and see how neighbors have improved their homes and landscapes. Choose different streets each time and look for clever examples for future improvements in your own home and garden.\n* Walk your garden and make a list of future improvements. Is it to repair the pool deck, add a patio, clean the gutters, touch-up chipped paint on house trim or outdoor furniture? Post the list where you'll see it and, if it can't be done all at once, plan to do it in stages when either time or money allows.\n* If you need help planning a new garden or revamping an existing, consider a consultation to get some ideas. Sloat Garden Design, for example, offers three options starting at $125. Check online for other companies, too.\nGloria Sanchez, manager of garden design department at Sloat Nursery in Mill Valley, has several suggestions for getting a jump on spring in the garden.\n* Look at the structure of the garden. Many plants have lost their leaves; what's left? Where can you add evergreen and winter blooming plants that will give your garden cohesion and balance? Consider adding boxwood, camellias or wonderfully fragrant winter-blooming daphnes.\n* Look for a place to plant a specimen tree. Elegant weeping cherries and magnolias are available in February.\n* Add structure with pots. Use a pair on either side of an entryway or a group them as a focal point in a distant view. They should be large enough to make an impact. To keep it simple, plant them with single evergreen shrubs.\nBrighten up pots at an entry or outside a window with primroses. They come in so many different cheerful colors and they love the winter chill.\n* Do some clean up. We don't recommend pruning plants that were damaged by our recent frosts yet, but if the plant has been killed, remove it.\n* Plan and freshen up your hardscape, such as decomposed granite and wood mulch paths.\n* Repair and paint fences and background walls.\n* Check and repair irrigation now while you can see the drip lines.\nSharon Begovich, owner of the Posh Planter in Novato, thinks February is a great time to take a look at plant containers and stands.\n* Choose an elegant container and add a stunning specimen plant. For drama, choose a plant that is sculptural or unusually textured.\nAs an example, in a large bowl-shaped planter, try a corylus avellana \"Contorta\" (Harry Lauder's Walking Stick) as your specimen. It has contorted branches and beautiful green, somewhat fan-shaped leaves spring through autumn. Its leaves turn yellow in autumn and drop, revealing an amazingly sculptural small tree. At the base, plant winter blooming perennials and annuals, such as hellebores, cyclamen and primrose. Choose the color of your annuals and perennials based on the color of the container you select.\nIn the summer, you can add more interest by switching out the cyclamen and primroses for late spring and summer blooming perennials and annuals.\n* Don't worry about planting too many plants in your container. Most people plant too few plants. Go for lush and dazzling, just the antidote to the winter blahs.\n* Use plant stands to elevate plants closer to eye level. This can showcase trailing plants, like ivies, coleus, dichondra \"Silver Falls,\" and, for spring and summer, lysimachia. This also works for a camellia that grows on a more horizontal plane. Select one of the new yellow varieties, and when you choose your companion plants, use colors that work with the color of the pot and the color of your camellia.\n* Pay attention to the scale of your design. Primroses, ivy and evergreen ferns would be good choices for winter and early spring companions to your camellia.\nPJ Bremier writes on home, garden, design and entertaining topics every Saturday and also on her blog atDesignSwirl.net .

Now, Navitas Naturals, located in Novato since 2004, is expanding, and Cooper's, offering locally sourced foodstuffs, is set to open Saturday, Jan. 25.\n\"This area, because it is agriculturally based, has a natural link to natural foods and healthy lifestyles,\" said Robert Eyler, head of the Marin Economic Forum. \"It's not a shocker that this business (Navitas) has grown in Novato. As the Marin food market evolves and draws in more farmers, the linkages between producing materials that could be marketed as natural or organic will develop.\" \nThe natural food business is healthy in more ways than one. Sales for all products in the $99 billion natural products industry increased 10 percent in 2012, according to the Natural Foods Merchandiser, a trade publication.\nZach Adelman, founder of Navitas, has immediate personal experience with such numbers. His superfoods company jumped from 42 employees in 2012 to 75 in 2013, expanded its production facilities and increased its revenue by $9 million, to $35 million, in 2013, growing along with the natural sector.\n\"In most cultures around the world, food is medicine, and we want to establish that thinking here in North America,\" Adelman said.\n\"We don't use traditional industrial food processing techniques,\" he said. \"We offer pure whole foods that are not compromised by high heat, additives, fillers or preservatives.\"\nThe company imports foods including maca, a root vegetable from Peru that looks like a radish, and chia, a plant in the mint family known for having omega-3 fatty acids, and processes them into powder to be used in cooking and shakes. Navitas also sells Power Snacks, nut-studded treats that look like energy bars cut into cubes.\nThe CEO decided to move to the Bay Area from Los Angeles when his wife Meghan got pregnant in 2003. \"I didn't want to raise my kids in L.A.,\" Adelman said. \"Besides, we had always wanted to live here.\"\nWhen they landed in Novato in 2004, Meghan joined the mothers group that was already making waves with its massive letter-writing campaign calling for a Whole Foods market in Novato. She became friends with members of the group including Alice Dow, though she didn't get involved in the campaign.\nNow, Navitas products are prominently featured in the Novato Whole Foods Market, as well as at stores around the country and Canada.\nThe Adelmans moved from Novato to San Anselmo with their two young sons in 2013, but the business remains committed to the city and to Marin, they said.\n\"We donate money to the Montessori school in Terra Linda, where our youngest son is a student,\" the CEO said. \"We also give to the Food Bank.\"\nLike the Adelmans, Dennis Cooper, proprietor of the soon-to-open Cooper's Public Market, has strong ties to Novato. He was born and brought up in the city. After graduating from high school, he left for a time, but returned in 2008.\n\"Whole Foods was just being built when I got here,\" Cooper said.\nHe got the idea to open a locally sourced market because \"when I moved to Novato, I thought it would be easier to have access to all the local stuff. It was easier, but there still wasn't a place where you could go where you knew everything was local,\" Cooper said.\nThe store, located in downtown's Town and Country Center on Grant Avenue between Fourth and Fifth streets, will host specialty tastings, guest speakers and authors, he said.\nThe store will feature produce, herbs and salts from Allstar Organics in Nicasio, Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese, rabbit and pastured pork from Devil's Gulch Ranch in Nicasio and all-natural, grass-fed beef and lamb from Stemple Creek Ranch in Tomales, among other offerings.\n\"They have agreements worked out with the farmers to provide them with a steady flow of product to sell,\" said Chris Stewart, Novato's economic development manager.\n\"The trend they (Cooper's and Navitas) are picking up on, and Whole Foods is the biggest chain to pick up on this, is bringing in less-processed foods,\" Stewart said. \"People want to get away from preservatives. High-end restaurants like the French Laundry have their own gardens now.\n\"This is a trend people are willing to spend money on. We are willing to pay more to get away from preservatives. When a product has a shelf life of a year or more,\" Stewart said, \"you know it's not fresh, and it usually doesn't taste fresh, either.\"\n\"We wanted healthier choices,\" said Dow, one of the ringleaders who got Whole Foods and Trader Joe's to come to Novato. \"It took us over three years. We had to gather signatures, do letter-writing.\"\nAt the time, then-councilwoman Carole Dillon-Knutson told the Independent Journal, \"Only 11 people came down to talk against the (Whole Foods) project, and there were hundreds   upwards of 800 or 900   who either spoke or wrote in favor of it.\"\n\"We lived and breathed this,\" Dow said. \"We all had kids under 5 years old, but this was our passion.\"\nEveryone in our neighborhood was driving either to San Rafael or Petaluma to go to Trader Joe's or Whole Foods,\" Dow said. \"We said we wanted to keep our money in Novato.\n\"We never gave up, and it was exciting when we won.\"\nContact Janis Mara via email atjmara@marinij.com .

Marin ordinarily does not suffer a lack of rain.\nWe suffer a lack of storage for it.\nAfter moderate rainfall, our reservoirs' spillways are over flowing. That is due to volumes of sediment which have collected there in the last 50 years.\nI have hiked around Phoenix Lake and Kent Lake (both Marin Municipal Water District reservoirs) for 20 years. Whole areas that used to be part of the lakes are now filled in and overgrown.\nIf Phoenix Lake is to be lowered by 20 feet, what better time to bulldoze and excavate and return this reservoir to its original capacity.\nThe same can be done to all our reservoirs in future years.\nI plan to do my part in conservation, but I will do so more willingly when I see some serious efforts to increase water storage in the MMWD watershed.\nMaria Pitcairn, Ross\nNOVATO\n'Optimistic vision'\nWhile I am glad the IJ continues to cover the story of Novato's Redwood Boulevard development corridor, I fear the editors are simply parroting what the developers want us to hear.\nNovato's Community Development Director Bob Brown did a great job opening up discussion and seeking public input, but the written choices that were actually presented to City Council did not reflect opinions that I heard at many of the meetings.\nWhen presented to council, the words were couched in phrasing that deferred to developer's problems with financing and existing infrastructure.\nThe intriguing architect's drawings that appeared at the meeting were indeed a result of public input, the charettes, but the actual words as presented in the guidelines assure us little more than a shopping \"area\" that has wide sidewalks along Redwood Boulevard.\nMost input I heard was for open areas and pedestrian circulation within the development, connecting to the SMART train and path and retaining a sense of place   such as tying in future development to Novato's agricultural heritage by using the old Dairyman's building.\nThat large, old five-story structure could be a hub with-in the development for attractive lifestyle retail shops and provide a disguised parking garage, for the inevitable cars, again within the area.\nAs these guidelines move forward toward adoption by City Council in the updating of the General Plan, I hope the optimistic vision that came from the public is actually in the written word not just the spoken word.\nSaxon Holt, Novato\nTRANSPORTATION\nInvesting in alternatives\nTwenty million seems like a lot to pay for a separate bicycle/pedestrian bridge path.\nThen again, adding 30 miles of HOV lanes to Highway 101 from the Novato Narrows in Marin to northern Sonoma will cost $921 million.\nNow that's an enormous amount to entice motorists to carry one more person.\nNinety-nine percent of \"transportation\" funding in the last century has gone to motor vehicles, paid for mostly from general funds and debts, not gas taxes and vehicle fees.\nThe federal gas tax fund was $10 billion below granted projects last year. State funds are also subsidized while local costs are mostly community funded.\nMost roads are designed to maximize motor vehicle traffic flow and speed. This has enormously increased hazards for cyclists and walkers, who also contribute to \"transportation costs.\"\nLittle wonder they only make 2 percent to 15 percent of trips in urban areas, depending on accommodations.\nFair is fair.\nThat tangle of freeway and boulevards creates an almost impenetrable barrier to these modes of transportation. Any critic should attempt to ride or walk through there first. Bicyclists and pedestrians require a flyover to pass through safely, without a complete redesign, which would cost far more than a bridge.\nIf the bridge design is unique, attractive and practical, they will flock over it.\nIt would be useful to provide an architect's illustration to decide if this one will be.\nStephen Simac, Stinson Beach\nENERGY\nFracking ban needed\nI'm thrilled that Gov. Jerry Brown finally declared a drought emergency, but conserving water is not sufficient.\nOur supposedly green governor has not yet declared a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing for gas and oil which accelerates climate change e.g. droughts and floods by releasing the super potent greenhouse gas methane.\nIt also uses up tons of scarce water and poisons the water table.\nThe United States Geologic Survey has documented earthquakes in unusual places near tracking sites. What the governor needs to do is support solar and wind installations throughout the state and stop kowtowing to the fossil fuel lobby.\nBarbara Rothkrug, Corte Madera\nIMMIGRATION\nThere's a big difference\nRegarding the IJ's Jan. 18 letter, \"Immigrants built nation,\" here we go again.\nWe are a nation built by \"legal\" immigrants.\nConsider this: My ancestors were required to \"apply\" for entry and wait to be called; \"have\" a U.S. citizen sponsor them, have a job waiting for them, have a place to live and pass a medical exam.\nDo you see a difference between legal and illegal?\nThere was no welfare, food stamps or MediCal.\nDo you see the difference?\nWhy are our unemployment and welfare recipient levels so high? Because illegal immigrants take the jobs first.\nAll the service jobs mentioned should go to the unemployed and those dependent on welfare.\nOr people should just clean your own home and do their own gardening.\nBob Guelfi, Novato\nGUN CONTROL\nWhy don't we ban cars?\nSo Jane Levinsohn wants to ban guns, does she?\nMaybe we should ban the weapon that kills and maims far more people than a gun   the automobile.\nWhat about alcohol?\nThat kills more people than guns, too.\nWhile we're at it, let's not forget cigarettes.\nLaws made due to emotion usually backfire anyway.\nI prefer freedom to slavery, even if freedom can be dangerous at times.\nJames Quigley, San Rafael", "author": "From  readers", "title": "Marin Readers' Forum for Jan. 25"}, {"relevance": [0.0], "text": "A man was kidnapped on the College of Marin campus in Kentfield and sexually assaulted at gunpoint in the Mill Valley area, authorities said.\nThe incident began at about 8:15 p.m. Thursday in parking lot 13 of the campus, the college reported.

San Rafael police said it sounded like \"small ammunition going off,\" San Rafael fire Chief Chris Gray said.\nTwo people were seen fleeing as firefighters arrived about 4 a.m. Although an investigation continues, the fire was apparently the result of a \"homeless encampment situation,\" officials said.\nTwenty-one firefighters on six engines, with crews headed by Battalion Chief Paul Crimmins, battled the fire behind the Sonnen BMW dealership near Kerner and East Francisco boulevards and Shoreline Parkway.\nA haze gripped the region as thick plumes of smoke billowed while fire crews, noting no structure was threatened, followed a safety strategy and poured water in from the sidelines, allowing the blaze to burn toward a firebreak.\n\"We've had problems there for the past several years,\" Chief Gray said, adding fire hazards triggered by homeless camps persist. City firefighters have responded to \"well over 20\" fires triggered by homeless encampments over the past several months, he added.\n\"It is not unusual to find a large amount of belongings, furnishings and debris within and around these encampments despite continued efforts to eliminate them,\" he said.\nThe fire underscored a \"red flag\" warning about high fire danger in the North Bay.\n\"It doesn't take much,\" the chief noted.\n\"With drought and high fire danger at a record high for January, residents and visitors are reminded to be fire safe and vigilant.\"\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

The county board, deferring to Southern Marin Supervisor Kate Sears, has declined to discuss the matter, although Sears on Thursday reaffirmed a pledge the board will hold a hearing next month. No date has been set.\nThe Board of Supervisors, bowing to community furor last summer, zapped the zone in Marinwood and Tamalpais Valley, but has been reluctant to follow suit in Strawberry, infuriating hundreds of residents who signed petitions. But the delay has allowed time for the grant picture to clear and the county to demonstrate the fiscal stakes, with public works staff drafting an application for $261,000 in regional transportation funds, a program indicating much more would follow. The county's bid for funds for \"analysis, planning, outreach and preliminary engineering\" for a variety of traffic improvements in Strawberry surfaced Thursday night, when it drew support from Sears but was promptly booted by the community.\nA number of those who attended the spirited session waved protest placards or held signs emblazoned with a photo of a 180-unit complex rising next to the freeway in Corte Madera.\n\"We've seen the future: No PDA in Strawberry,\" the signs said.\nThe 16-member transportation authority board, which includes county supervisors and a city council member from each city in Marin, sidestepped the controversy until the Board of Supervisors decides what to do. While dropping the Strawberry grant, the authority board approved up to $300,000 for downtown San Rafael transit center planning, and $100,000 for a study of the Fairfax-San Rafael transit corridor.\nSears cheered the county application for $261,000, noting the 1973 Strawberry Community Plan outlined traffic improvement needs that remain four decades later.\n\"It's way past time to take action,\" she said. \"I urge my colleagues to support the application.\"\nBut Novato Councilwoman Pat Eklund said that before the authority makes a funding decision, the Board of Supervisors   the \"elephant in the room\"   must figure out whether Strawberry will remain in the development area.\n\"I support transportation funding but not if it's something the community doesn't want,\" Eklund said. \"We will have that conversation,\" Supervisor Susan Adams replied.\nAdams joined other officials in trying to convince Strawberry residents that while the development area designation opened the door for extra transportation funds, it did not change zoning.\n\"The money does not come with any contingencies for development,\" said Tiburon Councilwoman Alice Fredericks, the authority's chairwoman. But few seemed to believe her, and she drew hisses after telling the crowd, \"We're here to listen but you have to tell us something.\"\nTwo dozen speakers had plenty to say to Fredericks and her colleagues.\n\"We want out of the PDA!\" said Jan Heinemann of Strawberry. \"Use your power to get us out!\"\n\"Your vision is not our vision,\" said Rob Martin of Strawberry.\n\"We have been without representation\" on the Board of Supervisors, said Charlotte Kissling. \"We have not been heard. We want out of the PDA.\"\n\"We come to you hoping you can help,\" said Tom Yurch of Strawberry. \"If you can't help us, we have no choice but to use the voting booth.'\n\"It would be such a shame to lose out on this future funding,\" said Kathy McLeod of Tiburon.\nDavid Schonbrunn of San Rafael, a veteran transit advocate who serves as president of Transportation Solutions Defense and Education Fund, said Strawberry residents have got it all wrong.\n\"What I see happening here tonight is a community of people who do not understand the planning process,\" he said.\n\"They are afraid,\" he observed.\n\"There is money available that will be helpful to this community,\" Schonbrunn said. \"This will make it safer. What's the problem?\"\n\"I don't buy it,\" said a woman who declined to provide her name. \"I'm from Corte Madera.\"\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

Humans and dogs live in packs and are usually adept at displaying emotions to and communicating. \nCats are one of the few domesticated animals that aren't pack animals. The ancestor of our house cats, the African wildcat (felis silvestris lybica), lives alone and is a solitary hunter. African wildcats don't need to cooperate with others to survive in the wild and they have less tolerance for unwelcome behaviors. They generally have two responses to upsetting behavior   fight or flight. Flight is generally preferred if there is a tree or another safe spot to find refuge.\nWhile the pack is important to people and dogs, territory is important to cats. In the wild, a cat's territory is its own private hunting ground. This ensures that it has enough food to eat. Marking its territory by scratching, rubbing and/or spraying (for unfixed animals) is a natural part of its life.\nHaving an indoor-only territory for your domestic cat is fine. Indoor kitties generally live three times longer than outside cats. However, you and your cat will be happiest if your home has appropriate places for it to climb, perch and scratch. If scratching posts are too short or unstable, cats may opt to use furniture.\nThe importance of territory can also help us understand why adding new cats to a household with cats must be done slowly. Your cat doesn't know that more food will magically appear when a new cat arrives. It believes it has to share all of its resources (food, water and you) with the newcomer. It may take time to realize that the newcomer isn't a threat and there will be enough resources to go around.\nMany people believe cats can't be trained. While it's true that cats don't respond to compulsory training, a cat's behavior can easily be modified by positive training methods. Cats learn by experience. Simply rewarding the behaviors you like and ignoring the behaviors you don't like is a good way to shape your cat's activities. Reprimanding a cat usually doesn't work. However, with the right techniques, cats can learn to come, sit, give you a high-five or even do agility.There are a variety of behavioral issues that can usually be resolved satisfactorily.\nThe Marin Humane Society offers a variety of cat behavior services, including a free cat behavior hotline (506-6284), in-home cat consultations and workshops for new and experienced cat guardians.\nBeth Weil is cat behavior consultant for the Marin Humane Society, which contributes Tails of Marin articles.

About 136,900 people in the county had jobs last month, with most employees working in the cities of San Rafael and Novato. The county's jobless rate improved in December by 1.4 percentage points from the same month in 2012. \nRobert Eyler, head of the Marin Economic Forum and a professor at Sonoma State University, said Marin is doing well, employing 2,900 more people in December than it did in December 2012.\n\"Obviously the employment rate continuing to shrink helps a lot,\" Eyler said.\nIn the region including Marin, San Francisco and San Mateo counties, the overall jobless rate dropped four-tenths of a percentage point in December to 4.6 percent   marking a large decrease from the December 2012 figure of 6.1 percent.\nSan Mateo had the second lowest unemployment rate in the state behind Marin with 4.6 percent, followed by San Francisco with 4.8 percent. In the West Bay counties of Marin, San Francisco and San Mateo, jobs increased by 6,400 to a little more than 1 million from November to December. Trade, transportation and utility services led the increase by adding 2,600 jobs   with retail accounting for 1,400 of those positions. Professional and business services increased by 2,100 jobs, much better than its average gain of 600 jobs at this time of year, and construction gained 300 jobs instead of seeing its usual December loss of 700 jobs.\nSince December of 2012, the number of jobs in the West Bay has climbed by 2.6 percent, or 26,700 jobs. Professional and business services added 10,600 jobs to reach its highest monthly total on record. Construction added 3,400 jobs and posted the fastest year-over job growth rate of any major industry group with 9.4 percent.\nWhen the January jobless figures are released, Eyler said it's possible the Bay Area and state could see an uptick in unemployment numbers as many seasonal jobs will have ended. In addition, the state's drought might also raise the unemployment rate.\n\"The water situation may have some effect on this,\" Eyler said. \"There might be some short-term job losses.\"\nAs people foresee the need to cutback on water and possibly pay more for water, some businesses may cut back on their workforce   especially in the farm and construction industries.\nFarm jobs in the Marin, San Francisco and San Mateo counties have decreased from December 2012 to December 2013 by about 100 jobs, according to the Employment Development Department. During that same year-long period construction jumped from 36,100 jobs to 39,500.\nCalifornia's jobless rate also improved in December to 8.3 percent, down from 8.5 percent in November. The state's jobless figure is 1.5 percentage points lower than it was in December 2012. A total of 13,600 nonfarm payroll jobs were added last month, bringing total job gains in the state to 922,500 since February 2010   when the department says the recovery from the recession began. The state's unemployment rate was at 9 percent or higher for five years until May 2013.\nThe national jobless rate declined from 7 percent to 6.7 percent in December despite a decline in job growth, with the Labor Department reporting Jan. 10 that only 74,000 jobs were created nationwide after four straight months of totals higher than 200,000.\nContact Megan Hansen via email atmhansen@marinij.com or via Twitter athttp://twitter.com/hansenmegan .

It just took him a few decades to figure out the perfect way to put things together.\nIt was worth the wait, however. His assemblages have led him to be artist-in-residence at the M.H. de Young Museum this month and an exhibit, \"Culture and Physics Collide,\" that runs through Feb. 2.\nNot bad for someone who almost threw out the gewgaws and doodads that dominate his art. \nZaklikowski had been collecting defunct electronics   computers, stereos, remote controls, telephones   taking them apart and cherry-picking the parts that spoke to him. After some 15 years, he had a rather substantial stockpile of visually compelling \"gems\" that filled up his Folsom Street studio and only a vague idea of what to do with it all.\n\"I got so sick of moving this stuff around,\" he says.\nThen something clicked. He began loading a 6-foot plywood square with hundreds of high-tech stuff like video cards, circuit boards, hard drives and motherboards, and the not-so-high-tech   kitchen gadgets, staple guns, tools and telephone cords.\nAfter months of working on the piece, \"Brainiac,\" he got compliments from people coming through his studio. He knew he was on to something.\n\"I am very good at taking things apart, and just a little bit better at putting them back together,\" the longtime 60-something Tiburon resident says with an impish smile. \"I made about 25 years' of work in about 6\u03a9 years. It was an absolute explosion.\"\nWhat he wanted to explore was the intersection of physics and art. Physicists and artists, he says, both seek to make sense of the world.\n\"I'm not a physicist, I haven't trained as a scientist, I've been following and reading a lot on the development of particle physics since I was a teenager and I still keep up with it,\" says Zaklikowski, who clearly enjoys telling stories and has a deep interest in and knowledge of Tibet, philosophy and, one quickly gathers, a lot of other things.\nHe's particularly enamored with physics and particle-physics detectors. \"They're kind of gorgeous in themselves,\" he says.\nOne piece, \"Collider Detector at Fermilab,\" is a meticulously detailed replica of the Tevatron detector at Fermilab, which was the largest particle accelerator in the world until it was decommissioned in 2011. But Zaklikowski's piece incorporates Parmesan cheese caps and a luo pan compass, a Chinese feng shui tool.\n\"Urbanism is the central idea behind these as well as science, technology, actually literature and music are involved in these as well. But the science and technology are easy to grasp,\" he says.\nHe takes a certain pleasure in making the practical impractical by rendering them useless as he gives them cultural value.\nHis art, which has a decidedly metropolitan look while also evoking the serenity of mandalas, has been called \"nothing short of jaw-dropping\" by Helium magazine, \"breathtaking\" by the Dogpatch Howler and something that would be appealing to \"everyone's inner eclectic artistic engineer\" according to Flavorpill.\n\"Zak's large-scale work and use of recycled materials creates a completely new and interesting environment that engages our visitors in conversations about the intersection of art and science,\" notes Dana Morrison, de Young public programs educator.\nNot all of his artworks are artistic replicas of particle detectors, however. One piece looks like a Steinway piano; one piece actually\nis a piano, albeit reconfigured and adorned with computer components, cellphones and musical instruments; and one is his son's old twin-size bed frame filled with thousands of Legos, also his son's, and other assorted tchotchkes.\nNaturally, kids are drawn to the bed   a gift for his son on his 13th birthday   and he welcomes them playing with the pieces and rearranging them.\nZaklikowski says he isn't making a statement about technology. He admits he's ambivalent about it.\n\"While technology is fascinating, it's extremely important, it has reconfigured the world quite simply, but the corporate structure of all these companies that make this stuff is pretty much similar to the corporate structure of most corporations, which has a great deal wrong with it,\" says Zaklikowski, who has two kids and a stepdaughter.\nHe feels similarly about cities, which he considers at once seductive and awe-inspiring while also problematic for their inhabitants and the Earth itself.\nBut don't ask him to explain what his art means. Art, he says, is pointless. That's why he makes it. Like the quote by composer John Cage he includes in his artist statement, \"I have nothing to say, and I'm saying it.\"\nVicki Larson can be reached at vlarson@marinij.com; follow her on Twitter at @OMGchronicles, fan her on Facebook at Vicki-Larson-OMG-Chronicles\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: \"John Zaklikowski: Culture and Physics Collide\"\nWhen: Through Feb. 2: 1 to 5 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays\nWhere: Kimball Education Gallery, M.H. de Young Museum, 50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Drive, San Francisco\nAdmission: Free\nInformation: 750-3528,zaklikowski.com\nMore: A free artist reception is from 3 to 5 p.m. Jan. 25; for a video profile of Zaklikowski, visit http://bit.ly/KAEVYZ\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Intricate designs made from discarded electronic parts comprise pieces by artist John Zaklikowski on Wednesday, Jan. 15, 2014, in San Francisco, Calif.

That change follows a bureaucratic stumble in which officials clearly said no trails would be abandoned, while the text of the draft plan clearly said otherwise. \nAt least for now, officials and their draft plan are on the same page.\nThat's not to say there shouldn't be a policy for eliminating trails deemed \"redundant\" or re-routing paths around environmentally sensitive areas. But the message from officials and the text of the plan they drafted should be consistent.\nThe inconsistency generated protests from many San Geronimo Valley residents who feared the county was trying to restrict their access. Besides eliminating some trails, the county was moving forward with rules requiring people to stay on the paths.\nThat drew blowback from those who want to wander off the trails.\nThe goal of that policy   a common-sense measure   is to protect flora and fauna from being trampled, or worse, discourage rogue bike trails from being senselessly carved across open space land.\nBut some hikers bristled, complaining that their opportunity to wander off trails was being restricted by an over-broad policy.\nThey see Marin's open space lands as undeveloped elbow room or space for recreation, not neighboring versions of Muir Woods National Monument.\nChanges in the draft plan seek to address that difference and strike a better balance.\nDevelopment of a new master plan for managing the county's open space trails and roads was probably overdue.\nThe process has been less than a model for public decision-making.\nCounty staff's initial refusal to release the draft plan for public review was not a public-confidence builder.\nWidespread public outreach that should have been part of an open and front-loaded process didn't happen until after the draft was issued. That's when the flak started flying.\nCounty officials said they met with stakeholders in shaping the draft. Obviously, they missed some.\nThe primary lesson learned is that Marin residents value their open space and their access to those public lands.\nIf prohibiting off-trail wandering is justified, those decisions should be made on a trail-by-trail basis, with clear reasons for the need to protect those areas.\nWide-open public review by the county parks commission and the Board of Supervisors should be essential steps in making those decisions.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: The entrance of Marin County Open Space at the end of Ridgewood drive in San Rafael, Calif.

At about the same time, she met Brazilian pianist and composer Marcos Silva, who produced, arranged and played on this comeback collection of 11 tunes, some straight jazz, some fusion, many with a Brazilian flavor.\nBacked by Silva, steel drummer Andy Narell, guitarist Barry Finnerty, bassist Scott Thompson, drummer Phil Thompson and 17-year-old saxophonist Chris Sullivan, Bell sings in her trademark earthy voice with relaxed assurance, as if she'd never been away. And her creative selection of material   including unusual renditions of Neil Young's \"Harvest Moon,\" Lennon and McCartney's \"I Will,\" Eden Ahbez's \"Nature Boy\" and Joni Mitchell's \"Night in the City\"   is inspired.\nWith \"Elation,\" Bell seamlessly picks up where she left off 25 years ago.\nBuy it: \"Silva-Bell-Elation,\" DeJa Music, CD Baby, $14.99 CD, $9.99 download\nHear her live: Dee Bell and the Marcos Silva Trio, \"Valentines Day Music for Lovers and Friends,\" 8:30 p.m. Feb. 14, American Legion Hall, 500 Magnolia Ave., Larkspur, $20 to $30\n  Paul Liberatore\nIf you're a musician or band from Marin with an album or EP that readers can buy or download and want to be reviewed, send your CD and contact information to Press Play, 4000 Civic Center Drive, Suite 301, San Rafael, CA 94903.\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Dee Bell and Marcos Silva's CD Silva - Bell - Elation", "author": "By Paul Liberatore", "title": "Press Play: The belated return of Dee Bell"}, {"relevance": [131.0], "text": "BOZ SCAGGS apologized for the lousy cellphone reception.

Now, when I come off the road, I just want to go up to the country where it's quiet. I'm spending more time in the country than I ever have before. It's a pretty good balance.\"\nAt 69, the gentlemanly singer-songwriter-winemaker is launching his first tour of the new year in February. It will bring him to the Marin Veterans Memorial Auditorium on Feb. 11, his first major concert in Marin in who knows how long. He says more than 20 years, but others seem to think it was longer than that, since around the time of \"Silk Degrees,\" the multi-platinum 1976 album that spawned four hit singles: \"It's Over,\" \"Lowdown,\" \"What Can I Say\" and \"Lido Shuffle.\" He had been a big name since the '60s as a guitarist and sometime lead singer of the Steve Miller Band, but \"Silk Degrees\" made him a star, a blue-eyed soul singer who looked cool as the other side of the pillow when he appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone in 1977, wearing a young man's smile and a hip white suit.\nBetween \"Slow Dancer\" in 1974 and \"Middle Man\" in 1980, he scored two gold and three platinum albums powered by a string of hits that included \"We're All Alone,\" \"Breakdown Dead Ahead,\" \"Jojo\" and \"Look What You've Done to Me.\"\nIn his concerts, he doesn't look down his nose at the nostalgic chord he strikes with his longtime fans, who have aged along with him. He and his six-piece band happily play revamped renditions of songs from each of the touring phases of his five-decade career, mixing them in with new tunes and some wild cards.\n\"People expect to hear things they remember you by from the radio, when they were of a certain age and that music was an important part of their lives,\" he said.\n\"Memphis\" released in March as his first studio album in five years, but he had already been touring with Michael McDonald and Steely Dan's Donald Fagen in the supergroup the Dukes of September. While most rockers of his age are looking to get off the road, he's found new inspiration playing once again for concert audiences across the country.\n\"I'd been touring quite a lot the last four or five years, and I love it,\" he said. \"I'd forgotten how much because I didn't tour that much before that. But I changed policy, saying I wanted to work more. It reminds me of why I started doing this in the first place. It's what I love to do.\"\nScaggs recorded the new album, a collection of impeccably tasteful covers of classic R&B songs, at the legendary Royal Studios in Memphis, Tenn., where Willie Mitchell created the sound that was so distinctive on all those Al Green hits in the 1970s.\n\"That place feels like you're walking into history,\" he said. \"The family that owns it has made a point of keeping it the same. They won't fix a hole in the roof. It's a powerful place. It's magic.\"\nThe album includes a couple of tunes by the late Willie Deville, including the first single, \"Mixed Up Shook Up Girl,\" an upbeat number with dark undertones. He turns in a soulful reading of \"Rainy Night in Georgia,\" which he first sang at a friend's memorial service, and resurrects the rarely covered \"Love on a Two-Way Street.\"\nHe gave himself 10 days to cut the tracks, but he was so comfortable in that famed studio that he and the band for the sessions   guitarist Ray Parker Jr., bassist Willie Weeks, Spooner Oldham on organ and keyboards, producer Steve Jordan on drums and the Memphis Horns   recorded 13 songs in three days, despite being continually interrupted by old friends and visitors stopping by to say hello.\n\"It was a little awkward the first day because we were trying to hit our recording stride, but every time we'd start a song the door would open and in would come some old friends and we'd stop everything, put the instruments down and take pictures and hang out,\" he said, chuckling. \"Then we'd get back into it and two hours later in would come the next group. I was wondering how we were going to get through all the songs on our list, but lo and behold it just happened. We did three or four songs a day. Then we put on some horns and some strings, had some barbecue and left town the next day.\"\nEven as he approaches 70, Scaggs hasn't lost the smooth tenor that made him one of his generation's most easily recognizable soul singers. Quite the contrary. And he's a man who seems more comfortable than ever in his own skin.\n\"This is the time of my life when I don't feel the pressure, or have the hormones, from when I was 20 or 30 or 40,\" he said. \"And I'm a better musician than I ever was.

Canaries are especially sensitive to methane and carbon monoxide, and a singing canary meant a good air supply. \nIf the canary died it was a time to evacuate. The canary served as the early warning system of imminent danger.\nMarin is experiencing its \"canary in the coal mine\" moment, and it comes by way of two specific events.\nThe first canary, barely able to breathe, is the building of the massive Wincup development in Corte Madera which provides a never ending reminder of what the Association of Bay Area Governments, and the compliant Marin supervisors, want Marin to look like in the future.\nABAG has set the stage with its massive overestimation of population and jobs for Marin from 2010 to 2040. Its projections are not defendable, and solely a poor top-down allocation to Marin, 482 percent higher than the state's projections for the same period for the county.\nMarin supervisors clearly agreed the projections were excessive in their response to the Plan Bay Area, but then agreed to the allocation. Their failure to stand up for Marin County on this issue is appalling and reason alone for voting them out without considering the failed $30 million computer system, out of control pensions and the much-discussed district discretionary funds.\nThe warning to all of Marin is ABAG, with compliant Marin supervisors, has approved developer-friendly plans that could turn Marin into a high-density corridor like Walnut Creek and the East Bay.\nThe second canary, that has certainly quit singing, is the current lack of rain.\nMarin gets a large portion, 80 percent in North Marin, from Sonoma and the Russian River. Sonoma continues to grow. Will they provide our current 80 percent if there is a major drought?\nAnyone who remembers the major drought of the '70s, with a smaller population than currently in Marin, does not have to imagine what those conditions would be like if we build out per the ABAG projections.\nPeter Hensel has completed an extensive review on the water issue in his comment on Plan Bay Area, and it is posted on Citizen Marin titled \"What about the water?\"\nMr. Hansel's public comment clearly outlines the flaws and issues not addressed or glossed over by Plan Bay Area regarding adequate water.\nWhat are the canaries warning us about?\nUpcoming massive traffic issues on Highway 101 caused by overbuilding high- density housing like Wincup, up and down the freeway corridor.

From the second grade, when I entered, through eighth grade, I was fairly oblivious to the absence of the opposite sex.\nAs a high school student, however, my friends and I were always looking for ways to connect with boys from other schools. This occupied so much of my time and psychic energy that I wonder if I wouldn't have been a better student if boys had just been in my classes with me. \nThe world is co-ed. It is never too soon to begin the work of educating both males and females to be more human and more humane.\nIf girls are typically disinclined to speak out in class with boys as they become adolescents, we must commit to preventing this Ophelia effect. If teen-age boys are prone to grabbing the spotlight, why don't we teach them to be more empathic and inclusive?\nRather than keeping the sexes separate, San Domenico can be one of the many high schools that educates them together the right way. If any institution can rise to that challenge and succeed at it, I believe it is San Domenico.\nThirty years ago, I worked for two years as director of admissions of San Domenico Upper School. I know well the issues facing today's board as they are the same challenges I faced in 1984. Lack of interest in single-gender high schools, ever-rising tuition, and religious affiliation made it a struggle to fill a freshman class then, as now.\nThoughtful and committed boards comprised of lay and religious members of the community have spent the intervening 30 years attempting to solve this conundrum with every solution short of co-education, and nothing has worked.\nWhen I was school superintendent, I led the district in the closure of one of its three neighborhood schools. The process was painful, emotional, and ultimately, inevitable.\nSince the financial picture at San Domenico offers no other real options than to expand admissions by welcoming boys into the high school, we need to stop focusing on the whys and the what ifs, and get to work on the how. The fact that the Lower School has done nothing but thrive since the advent of boys into the program bodes well for this evolution in the high school.\nI would rather see a co-ed San Domenico School, unifying the campus into the one school the faculty envisions, than lose the high school altogether, which the analysis indicates will be the result of continuing on as an all-girls program.\nLiz Schott, Sebastopol, Class of 1975\nPay more for less water\nLast time we had a water shortage, the Marin Municipal Water District asked customers to cut their use.\nWe did.\nThen the district raised rates because it did not have enough revenue because the citizens successfully responded to its request.\nDid the district increase water storage capacity to better manage resources after the last shortage? Not much.\nIt appears a water shortage is a \"perfect storm\" for the MMWD customers.

His father, who has attended previous hearings, was not present.\nUnder the sentence, Wade could theoretically be released before he turns 40. First, he will have to serve 85 percent of a sentence of 21 years and four months, then begin serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole.\nBut he can start applying for parole once his life sentence begins, said his defense attorney, Charles Dresow. And Wade has accrued nearly two years' worth of credits for the time he has spent in jail since the case began.\nThe investigation began on April 13, 2012, when a black-clad motorcyclist opened fire on a pickup truck in Mill Valley. The couple inside the truck   Landon Wahlstrom, 18, and girlfriend Eva Dedier, 17, of Terra Linda   ducked and were only slightly injured by flying glass.\nMarin County sheriff's investigators were able to rapidly identify the suspect as Wade, who was known to supply Dedier and other teens with fake IDs. Authorities alleged that Wade desired Dedier and was jealous she was dating Wahlstrom.\nThe investigation ultimately led detectives to tail Wade to a storage locker he rented in Richmond. Wade pulled a loaded Glock handgun from his waistband as detectives closed in to make the arrest, but he was tackled before there was any gunfire.\nInside the storage locker, investigators found a trove of evidence that included burglary equipment, fake IDs and a $200,000 yellow Lamborghini belonging to restaurateur and television chef Guy Fieri. The car was stolen from a San Francisco dealership in 2011 by a burglar who rappelled from a high window, authorities said.\nInvestigators also found evidence that Wade was planning a heist at a jewelry store to steal about $6 million in merchandise.\nWade was charged as an adult even though he was 17 when he was arrested. In October, a jury convicted him of attempted murder against Wahlstrom, firing a gun into an occupied vehicle and possession of the stolen Lamborghini.\nThe jury determined there was insufficient evidence to convict him of attempted murder of Dedier and the burglary at the car dealership.\nAt the sentencing hearing Thursday afternoon, Dresow, the defense attorney, argued that giving Wade a life sentence would be unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment. Dresow also argued that no one was seriously injured in the gun attack, that Wade was 16 and 17 years old when he committed the crimes, and that he had a lonely childhood with insufficient parental supervision.\nBut he conceded that the judge had little discretion in the sentence. Prosecutor Yvette Martinez-Shaw said: \"A life sentence is mandatory, and it is also warranted.\"\nDedier and Wahlstrom did not attend the sentencing.\nContact Gary Klien via email atgklien@marinij.com orhttps://twitter.com/GaryKlien\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Leylla Wade, mother of Max Wade, leaves court after her son's sentencing in San Rafael, Calif. on Thursday, Jan. 23, 2014.

Our rivers and lakes are gasping as California enters its second frightfully dry year, and fish populations are sure to take a hit from the drought.\nStreams where trout spawn have dried up, and the state's bigger rivers are being lowered as water managers try to conserve reservoir volume. Thousands of nests of salmon that have spawned in the Sacramento and American rivers have been dried out and destroyed, and the Russian River is being similarly dewatered with cutbacks on reservoir releases. Up the coast, the Gualala, the Eel and the Klamath all need water, and many winter Coho and steelhead may not spawn unless the rivers swell. \nGreg Andrew, biologist with the Marin Municipal Water District, said some of the Mount Tamalpais reservoirs could take a hit from the drought. Spawning habitat for bass and sunfish in Nicasio and Alpine lakes will deteriorate as the lakes dwindle, he said. Nicasio, for one, has shrunken to a puddle. Bon Tempe and Lagunitas, however, are in better shape. Their waters have not been seriously depleted, and on Wednesday they even received a shot of fish   about a thousand small trout each. The rainbows should be acclimated and ready for business this weekend.\nSturgeon fishing continues to reward those using shrimp baits on anchor in San Pablo Bay, according to Kevin Wolfe, assistant at Loch Lomond Bait Shop, and big tides are coming next weekend.\nHowever, signs of the drought are apparent. The bait shop's salinity gage read 24 parts per thousand on Wednesday   about as high as it gets in San Rafael, Wolfe said, and plainly a reflection of the meager inflow of water from the delta. Most ocean water salinity measures about 35 parts per thousand. (During a wet season several years ago, some anglers reported tasting the water flowing out the Golden Gate and finding that it was as palatable as tap water   completely fresh.)\nHerring have been swarming into the bay through January, appearing near Tiburon, at Sausalito and, several days ago, at China Camp. Commercial netters have taken a few tons, birds and sea lions have feasted and recreational beachgoers have even taken some fish using casting nets. Pickling fillets of the herring in brine and vinegar is a popular preparation method.\nWolfe said the China Camp herring spawn is of particular interest.\n\"We've never seen them spawn that far into the bay before,\" he said.\nHerring lay their eggs in saltwater, and the ocean has crept deep into the estuary in the absence of precipitation. In fact, starry flounder are being reported well into the Napa River   as far upstream as downtown Napa, according to Dave Hurley, writer of the subscriber fishing report HotSheet.\nWeather forecasters predict clear skies for weeks.\nOut of state\nFor many years, during periodic trips across the American West, Novato resident Larry Lack looked up at the slopes of Nevada's Ruby Mountains from his car on Highway 80. Even in mid-summer, snow covered the two-mile-high peaks.\n\"I got to thinking that with all that snow up there, there had to be water and someplace to fish,\" Lack said.\nIn 2008, he took the time to leave the highway and approach the Rubies, sniffing for streams. Somewhere east of the range, Lack discovered some of the finest trout fishing in the unlikeliest of places   a small irrigation canal flowing slowly southward.\nThe clear water, Lack said, is five feet deep and about 30 feet wide and not, perhaps, the most picturesque of concrete-lined waterways.\n\"But it's packed with 20- to 25-inch brown trout,\" said Lack, who will be visiting the fabled canal this weekend with two friends, David Weckler and Rick Yoshimoto, both of Marin.\nFishermen know that secrets that get let out can't be put back in their box, so Lack declined to further describe the ditch. I wouldn't have named it, anyway. For one of the most exciting components of fishing is unguided exploration, and while opportunities for seeking out virgin waters are fewer by the season, dream streams still flow, it seems.\nThey just might not have any water in them this year.\nAlastair Bland is a Bay Area fisherman.

Hopefully we will be able to incorporate all we have heard today\" in the next draft of the trails document. \"It's a work in progress.\"\nThe plan will be revised this spring, and might be discussed at a commission meeting in March, before a final draft is presented to county supervisors during public hearings next summer.\n\"It's not 1969 anymore,\" said parks director Linda Dahl. \"We are seeing all kinds of changes and challenges.\" The few who do not follow the rules make it worse for all others, she said.\nRegarding trail scofflaws, \"these are not bad boys on weekends,\" Dahl said. \"It's people coming in with lunch buckets at midnight.\"\nAt French Ranch in San Geronimo, she said, those who built an illegal 2.5-mile trail cut down 67 trees in the process.\nThursday's \"informational\" session dealing with the merits of the trails plan was an oddity because it leapfrogged the environmental impact process, a situation that could pose legal peril. After time for public comment on the plan's environmental report ended, parks staff bowed to protests from people who took issue with merits of the plan by softening several proposals.\nCommission chairman Greg Zitney called the situation \"kind of unprecedented,\" saying the impact report may have to be resubmitted for a new round of review.\nParks officials are consulting with county lawyers to determine how to proceed. \"I am happy to hear you are consulting with counsel,\" Zitney told the staff.\nThursday's session, which was held at the county Civic Center, keyed on changes to the plan following a cascade of public commentary. The revisions allow hikers to walk off roads and trails   unless they are accompanied by dogs. Hikers with dogs, and all equestrians and bicyclists, will not be allowed to venture off roads and trails.\nThe revised plan outlines a public process that will designate an official road and trail system. Existing roads and trails that do not become part of the system will be closed as time allows. The revised document also simplifies and clarifies a number of proposals.\nIn sharp contrast to a contentious, sometimes raucous session last year, the plan drew a largely favorable reaction from a cordial crowd of 75, and representatives of various organizations among the two dozen speakers who took to the podium said they looked forward to helping craft the final plan.\nA note of discord was sounded by several in the mountain biking community who said the county is limiting use of trails by cyclists.\nParks officials \"seem to be vehemently anti-mountain biker,\" said Rich Cerick of Fairfax. \"I'm reminded of the 1950s when motorcyclists were viewed as outlaws.\"\nRepresentatives of biking groups tempered their comments, noting that despite a grim slide show unveiled at the meeting by parks officials of illegal trails and environmental degradation by bike \"jump\" enthusiasts, most bikers were law abiding citizens who care for the environment.\n\"You listened to what people have to say,\" Michael Kelley of the International Mountain Biking Association told parks staff. \"We've seen some change, flexibility and willingness to compromise.\"\nStan Dennison of Novato, speaking for Access4Bikes, called the plan's revisions a \"momentous step in the right direction\" and expressed hope the cycling community will be treated fairly.\nEquestrians called safety a priority, urged bicycling to be limited and called for enforcement of a 15 mph speed limit. Equestrian Connie Berto of Sleepy Hollow urged the licensing of bicycles and called for safety standards and enforcement specifics.\n\"The plan is too vague as far as trail use goes and enforcement goes,\" she said.\nEric Moray of Woodacre balked at regulations requiring the leashing of dogs, saying \"well behaved off-leash dogs (accompanied by) their owners\" were being \"criminalized\" as lawbreakers.\n\"Please rethink your off-leash dog policy,\" he said.\nFairfax Councilman John Reed expressed the town's interest in the plan, and added that while residents have concerns, \"we're very encouraged by the proactive stance being taken here.\"\nConservationists chimed in as well. \"Resource conservation is the number one priority of the plan,\" said Nona Dennis of the Marin Conservation League. \"What we are hearing from people pushing back on this plan is more, more, more,\" she said, referring to cyclists who want more bike trails.\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

She is former head of Novato Human Needs Center and the Marin Institute.\nConti, who also worked as deputy drug program administrator for the county of Sonoma, is founding president of West Bay Housing Development Corp., which provides housing for people with special needs, and a board member of American Public Health Association.\nAs a college trustee, Conti has earned a reputation as a consensus builder, and took a lead role in working to resolve conflict including turmoil in the college's scholarship foundation program.\nContact Nels Johnson via email atnjohnson@marinij.com .

But the teachers, Nate MacDonald and Julia Marrero, were seeing an imbalance of students that wasn't sitting well with them.\n\"We have two girls in our engineering class, out of 70,\" MacDonald said. \"We decided that needed to change.\"\nRecognizing that girls tend to lose interest in math and science before reaching teenhood, MacDonald and Marrero held a \"Girls Ignite\" event Wednesday night at the Fairfax school. Fifth-, sixth- and seventh-grade girls from throughout the Ross Valley School District were invited for a two-hour summit to get them interested in the STEAM subjects   science, technology, engineering, art through digital creation, and math. \nAbout 150 girls showed up, representing nearly half of the district's female students in those three grade levels.\n\"It's exciting to have all this girl power in one room,\" Marrero told the group.\nTo kick off the session, the girls split into five groups for presentations from women who work in the STEAM professions, ranging from software engineers to a blacksmith.\nIn the second hour, the girls were put to work.\nEach one was asked to assemble her own wearable art. On this night, the goal was to make a broach that looks like a flower   and lights up.\nOnce the felt pieces were layered, the LED light   about half the size of a typical Christmas tree light bulb   was placed in the middle of the flower. From there, each girl had to figure out how to illuminate the bulb, by fastening a coin cell battery to the back of the broach and making sure it was properly connected to the bulb's two wires.\n\"To understand how to light up their LED light, they have to understand the slightest bit about circuitry,\" Marrero said.\nWhile the goal of the evening was to stimulate interest in the STEAM subjects, the activities were strategically geared toward girls, Marrero said. Hence, creating a wearable flower.\nThe approach appeared to work. The girls appeared to be fully engaged, intent on accomplishing the task and figuring how to make their pieces light up.\n\"It's really fun,\" said Lola Palladini, a White Hill sixth-grader. \"I really like to make all sorts of things and learn how they work.\"\nMacDonald said he hopes the evening will get more girls interested in taking STEAM-related classes, and eventually pursue related professions. He said there is a real-world benefit to having women in the STEAM professions.\n\"Girls have a different perspective on solving problems,\" MacDonald said. \"They have a great ability of working together, and they want to solve the world's problems.\n\"We certainly need as many angles and solutions with the challenges we have.\"\nIf the evening accomplishes what MacDonald and Marrero intended it to, many of the girls who attended will end up going the route of White Hill eighth-grader Maya Krause, one of those two girls in the school's engineering class.\nKrause said she has had a lot fun building robots, creating a video game and designing a motorized metal claw that can pick up objects. And in her free time, she's learning how to design web pages, with the thought that she may one day want to do that for a career.\n\"I like the building. I really like the programming,\" Krause said. \"I think it's really exciting.\"\nContact Laith Agha via email atlagha@marinij.com\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Liana Merrel, 10, gets help from Dillan Ross, 11, as they make an LED brooch during the Girls Ignite STEAM event at White Hill Middle School in Fairfax, Calif. on Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2014.

I told myself, 'I have a lot of work to do.'\"\nA little more than a year later, it's also safe to say Easom has put in the work necessary to raise her game to a higher level.\nAs a sophomore, the 5-foot-10 Easom starts in the backcourt for the Vikings averaging 31 minutes and 11.4 points a game, third best on the team.\nAlthough her freshman season got off to a bit of a bumpy start, before it was over a rash of injuries forced her back into the lineup on a regular basis. She ended up starting 10 games.\n\"We just had a slew of starters out almost every game with injuries last year,\" Portland state coach Sherri Murrell said. \"I always tell the freshmen, 'Be ready, you never know when your number's going to be called.' Emily did a great job when we called her number.\"\nEven though she wasn't quite ready for prime time, Easom says the significant playing time she logged last season is proving invaluable now.\n\"Playing as freshman really helped this year as a sophomore,\" she said. \"I already had game experience and that really makes a difference.\"\nThat fact was more than evident when Easom erupted for a career-high 26 points on a 12-of-15 shooting night in leading Portland State (5-11, 3-4 Big Sky Conference) to an 83-80 conference victory over visiting Sacramento State last week.\n\"She's really coming on,\" Murrell said. \"She's just so competitive. She wants to win. I always expect a little more out of her. Then I have to remind myself she's only a sophomore. But she really wants to make an impact on the program.\"\nEasom says she was forced to adjust her mindset in order to excel at the college level. She said she has been playing basketball most of her life, but that was no longer enough.\n\"Once you get (to college), it's a slap in the face,\" she said. \"You have to wake up and change right now. You have to spend extra time in the gym and in the weight room. On your off days you can always be doing something to improve your game, always thinking of ways to improve.\"\nAnd Easom has learned it's no part-time gig.\n\"It's a different world,\" she said. \"In high school, basketball is a winter sport. But when you're in college, basketball is year round. It's your job.\"\nEasom's specialty is shooting. She set a school record in her junior season at MC by netting 61 3-pointers. In fact, in the victory over Sac State she was the only player on the court Murrell gave Carte Blanche for shooting 3-pointers.\n\"The whole game plan (against Sac State) was to hit a lay-up in the first 10 seconds (of the shot clock),\" Murrell said. \"And the only person who could shoot a 3 before that was our go-to person, and that was Emily.\"\nEasom, who's favorite NBA player is the Warriors' Stephen Curry, says confidence is the key to shooting.\n\"It's all about forgetting that play if you miss and moving on to the next play,\" said Easom, who leads the Vikings with 28 3-pointers. \"I definitely know when I'm in a groove after the first couple of shots. You can feel the surge of confidence and you're in the zone. There are days when you hit everything, and then days when you can't make a bucket to save your life.\"\nMurrell never doubted Easom's shooting ability. But the coach was looking for improvement in the rest of her game.\n\"One of the things I'm most impressed with is how much she has improved the other parts of her game,\" Murrell said. \"Against Sac State she hit couple of jump shots and took some to the hoop. On defense she's smart and works very hard.\"\nEasom leads the Vikings with 18 steals.\nJudging by recent results, Easom is over the anxiety of competing against some of the best college players in the nation which included a rugged preseason schedule, ranked 47th toughest in the nation.\nThat, however, is not necessarily so.\n\"I get nervous before every game,\" she said. \"That's how you know you care. But it goes away and then you just play the game.\"\nAround campus\n* Redwood grad Dylan Morris, a San Anselmo resident and a 174-pound sophomore on Stanford's wrestling team, has not forged his way into the starting lineup yet. A Redwood graduate, Morris, who was seventh at the state tournament as a high school senior, has a 13-7 record with three pins, a technical fall and two third-place tournament finishes.\n* Tyler Gaffaney, a 6-4 senior guard on the Claremont-Mudd Scripps men's basketball team, continued his outstanding season with 28 points, four assists and four steals Saturday in the Stags' 75-50 victory over Caltech. Gaffaney, from Mill Valley and a graduate of Branson, is the top scorer at 18 points per game for CMS, which improved its Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference record to 6-0.\n* Dominican men's basketball player Connor Haysbert has been nominated for 2014 National Association of Basketball Coaches Good Works Team. Nominees are recognized for their charitable achievements and community involvement. Haysbert volunteers at Marin General Hospital in the surgery recovery center, tutors students in biology and participates in the Kaiser pre-med mentorship program. The 10 winners of the award, picked out of 117 nominees from across the nation, will be announced in February.\nTim Menicutch covers college sports for the IJ.
